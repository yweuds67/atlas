# ADR-0014: The organisation tool server acts as the signed-in user, and outward actions ask first

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-26)

## Context

The user wants Atlas Agent to read the organisation's recorded work (recorded sessions, comments,
members, conversations) and act in it: post a session report to a channel or a DM, reply to and
resolve comments, write a page in a Space. The server has no bot or service identity; every call
carries the signed-in user's JWT and everything written appears as that user. The desktop already
holds every needed client in Rust (`atlas-comms`, `atlas-artifacts`, `atlas-checkpoint::sync`,
`AuthCore`), and the renderer never holds a token.

Two Atlas-offered tool servers exist (ADR-0010 memory, ADR-0012 UI). Both are projected into the
engine as auto-approved, and ADR-0012 makes that acceptable by keeping its whole surface
non-destructive by rule. Sending a message to a colleague cannot be made non-destructive by rule:
it is not undoable and it is in the user's name.

## Decision

**A third MCP service, `atlas_org`, the organisation tool server, mounted on the same listener
behind the same per-session token as the other two.** It is offered only to a connection that
carries **organisation access**, a connection property like UI control (the in-process native
connection sets it; ACP does not; nothing branches on agent id), behind one setting (default on,
checked at offer and on every call), and only when the session's Project is cloud-bound.

**A tool call acts in the organisation the session's Project is bound to**, carried on the
per-session grant when the offer settles, never in whichever organisation the window is showing
and never chosen by the model. The app's two org ids (active, comms) are not consulted; if chat is
targeting a different organisation, chat tools refuse.

**Outward actions ask first.** A call that reaches another person (sending a message, replying on
a comment thread, creating a DM) is projected with per-tool `Prompt` approval, so the existing
approval card (allow once / allow for this session / reject) shows the recipient and the full body
before anything leaves the device. Resolving a comment and creating or writing a page are visible
and reversible, so they stay auto-approved with the audit rows ADR-0012 established. This is the
first Atlas-offered server that prompts, and that departure from ADR-0012 is deliberate.

**Roles are the server's.** The recorded-work surface is flat server-side (anyone who can see a
Workspace may read, comment, resolve, search). The client mirrors the caller's role only to omit
the one admin tool (member activity) from the offer and to explain a 403; it enforces nothing the
server does not.

## Consequences

- No attribution marker is appended to agent-written messages: the user approved the exact words,
  and a text suffix is not provenance. A "via Atlas Agent" server field is a server follow-up.
- Search by member or date is a client-side fold over the board (default 14 days, at most 500
  recorded sessions, truncation reported), because the server filters only by Workspace and keyword.
- A session report carries a Session Reference; when the Workspace is not organisation-visible the
  reference is dropped for the plain link and the model is told.
- Space page content crosses to the webview as a node-and-edge JSON with optional positions; the
  frontend owns layout and the Yjs codec, and Rust stays a pipe (`crates/atlas-comms/src/spaces.rs`).
- Twelve flat tools, roughly 3 KB of fixed prefix per native turn.
- The engine asks for a prompted tool with an MCP elicitation of its own and keeps no session
  approval for one, so the native seam serves that one elicitation (ADR-0013) and remembers "allow
  for this session" per session and tool itself (`engine/tool_approvals.rs`).
- Consent is enforced by the tool server, not by the engine's ask alone: the native seam records
  each call the user approves (on its card, or under "allow for this session") through the host in
  a one-shot `OutwardConsent` keyed by session, tool and arguments, and `atlas_org` posts only a
  call it finds there — so in bypass mode, where the engine runs a prompted tool unasked, an
  outward action is refused and nothing is sent.
- Reversed the same way as ADR-0012: if per-session consent is ever needed, the flag moves onto
  the session request, still never onto agent identity.

## Amendment (2026-09-27): the card is prepared, and a message is never allowed for the session

Two decisions from the 0.3.4 hardening pass (`docs/qa/0.3.4-hardening-report.md`, O1 and O2):

- **The card waits for its description.** Describing a call can take several network reads; the
  first version raised the card after five seconds with the call's bare arguments (truncated to
  4000 characters, no resolved recipient), so the user could approve words they did not see. Now a
  **preparing** card goes up at once — "Preparing the approval…", with only Decline — and is replaced
  by the described card when the host answers. There is no fallback to the arguments: a host that
  cannot describe the call, or is still silent after two minutes, ends the ask with a refusal and
  nothing is sent (`crates/atlas-native-agent/src/engine/tool_approvals.rs`).
- **A message asks every time.** "Allow for this session" on `org_send` covered every later
  message — any recipient, any words, a new DM — with no card, while the model reads text other
  people wrote (comments, session titles, the inbox). The host now declares tools that ask **every
  time** (`AskFirst::every_time`, `EVERY_TIME_TOOLS`): their card offers Allow and Decline only, and
  no allowance is kept for them. A reply keeps "Allow for this session": it can only land on a
  thread the model names by id.
