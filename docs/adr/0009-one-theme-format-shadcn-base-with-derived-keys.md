# ADR-0009: One theme format — shadcn base tokens, optional palette and keys, everything else derived

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-17). Plan and audit: `docs-atlas/content/private/theme-system.mdx`.

## Context

Atlas had two theme systems: 6 "interface themes" and 10 "editor themes". Both were hardcoded TypeScript and dark-only.

- An interface theme set 33 of the 170 CSS variables in `tokens.css`. Everything else stayed at Atlas Black's values.
- About 686 colour literals bypassed tokens entirely.
- The terminal, the chat code highlighting, the graphs and the charts ignored the theme altogether.

That is why Rosé Pine "didn't apply everywhere": nothing guaranteed that every colour was either set by the theme or computed from it.

## Decision

**One theme covers the whole app.** A **theme** is one TOML file with a `dark` and/or `light` **variant**. It covers chrome, editor, terminal, diffs and syntax; there is no separate editor theme. Each variant has three levels:

1. **Base tokens** (required). These are the shadcn/ui token set, named exactly as shadcn names them, so any shadcn or tweakcn theme is a valid base.
2. **Palette** (optional). Eight named hues: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, pink.
3. **Theme keys** (optional). Atlas-specific colours, named by role in Zed's dotted style (`element.hover`, `terminal.ansi.red`, `syntax.keyword`).

**Every theme key has a derivation rule.** A missing key is resolved in this order: explicit key → palette-derived → base-derived → Atlas default for that appearance. The resolver runs in TypeScript and emits a fully resolved variable map, which is also used by non-CSS consumers such as xterm, pixi and recharts. A test asserts that every key resolves to a colour for every built-in theme.

**Rust owns theme files.** Rust parses and validates built-in themes and the themes in `~/.config/atlas/themes/`. The frontend receives JSON.

**One key-naming rule.** No key may be both a leaf and a prefix of another key, so the dotted names are valid unquoted TOML (`border.subtle`, not `border`).

**Import is one-time conversion into this format.** Sources are shadcn/tweakcn, Zed and VS Code; each converted source is never read again.

**File icons are a separate icon theme.** Icon themes use VS Code's `iconThemes` format verbatim, so VS Code icon themes install as-is.

## Considered options

- **Two pickers (interface and editor), as before.** Rejected. Neither VS Code nor Zed does this; both use one theme plus user overrides, and one artefact is simpler for community contributors.
- **shadcn tokens only, deriving everything else.** Rejected. A 31-token palette cannot say what Rosé Pine's syntax or ANSI colours are.
- **An Atlas theme as a shadcn registry item with extras in `meta`.** Rejected. The registry format has no place for per-variant palette or syntax data. Instead we export shadcn registry JSON, which is lossy only for the Atlas extras.
- **JSON theme files.** Rejected in favour of TOML. TOML allows comments, forgives trailing commas, and matches `config.toml`. JSON Schema still drives editor completion via `#:schema`.
- **Derivation in CSS with `color-mix()` and relative colour syntax.** Rejected, on the consumer argument: a CSS-derived colour cannot feed xterm, the two pixi graphs, recharts or CodeMirror, all of which need a concrete value and cannot read a custom property. This bullet originally also gave a browser-support argument ("relative colour syntax needs Safari 16.4, but Atlas's minimum is macOS 11") and let it stand for both features. That was wrong for `color-mix()`, and the amendment below states the real policy.

## Amendment (2026-09-18): `color-mix()` at a call site

The rejection bullet above was read as a blanket ban on `color-mix()` anywhere, and `docs/reference/design-system.md` restated it that way. The ban does not hold up, and the rule is now drawn where the constraint actually is.

**`color-mix()` needs Safari 16.2; relative colour syntax needs 16.4** — the bullet cited the 16.4 figure against both. More decisively, the shipped stylesheet already carries **71 unconditional `@property` at-rules** emitted by Tailwind v4, and `@property` needs Safari 16.4; Tailwind v4's own documented floor is Safari 16.4. Banning `color-mix()` on a 16.2 argument while the utility layer requires 16.4 buys nothing. macOS 11's terminal Safari is 16.6.1, so `minimumSystemVersion = 11.0` does not imply a pre-`color-mix()` WKWebView either — only a Big Sur install that stopped updating does, and that install already renders Tailwind v4 degraded.

So:

- **A theme key is never derived in CSS.** `keys.toml` plus the TypeScript resolver is the one derivation site, for the consumer reason above. Unchanged.
- **`color-mix()` may tint an already-resolved token at a call site**, on the same footing as Tailwind's `/N` opacity modifier (which the build emits as an rgba fallback plus an `@supports` upgrade).
- **Relative colour syntax stays banned**: Safari 16.4, no fallback, and nothing needs it.

Replacing the 23 existing call sites was considered and rejected: each is a presentational tint, so it would mean either ~15 new public theme keys — days after the key-set audit cut 135 to 73 precisely because zero-consumer keys are a liability — or 23 new TypeScript-resolved values each needing a theme subscription, i.e. 23 new chances for a stale palette.

## Consequences

- **The token names are a public contract.** Renaming a base token or theme key breaks community themes, so the TOML carries `schema = 1`.
- **`accent` changes meaning.** It now follows shadcn: a hover/selected surface. Atlas's brand colour is `primary`.
- **User settings move.** `atlasTheme` and `codeEditorTheme` in `config.toml` are replaced by `theme`, `themeMode` and `themeOverrides`. Old values are migrated once.
