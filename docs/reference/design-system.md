# Design system

The non-colour half of Atlas's design system: the scales, what they are called,
which primitive to reach for, and the test that stops the app drifting back off
them. Colour is the other half and lives in [`theme-keys.md`](./theme-keys.md).

Everything here is defined in two files:

| file | holds |
|---|---|
| `src/styles/tokens.css` | the raw custom properties on `:root` — the shadcn base tokens, control heights, layout constants, radius derivation, elevation, motion durations and z-index layers |
| `src/styles/globals.css` | the Tailwind namespaces (`@theme`), the named utilities (`@utility`), and the global focus rule |

Primitives live in `src/ui/`. The gallery that renders all of it is the dev-only
mock scenario **`localhost:1420/?scenario=design-system`** — open it before and
after any change to this page.

## Naming rules

1. **Use a Tailwind namespace if one exists.** Type is `--text-*`, radius is
   `--radius-*`, elevation is `--shadow-*`, easing is `--ease-*`, blur is
   `--blur-*`, spacing is Tailwind's `--spacing` multiplier. Only z-index,
   control heights and durations are custom, because Tailwind's equivalents take
   bare numbers and cannot be given names.
2. **A scale step is named, never measured.** `text-xs`, not `text-[11px]`;
   `z-popover`, not `z-[9999]`. The number belongs in `tokens.css` exactly once.
3. **A token is a role, not a value.** There are no 12-step colour ramps and no
   per-component colour tokens. A theme key exists only when a theme author
   needs that surface to differ from the base tokens.
4. **One name per colour.** The legacy aliases are gone: `--bg-*`, the colour
   `--text-*`, `--cm-*`, `--shadow-overlay`, `--z-max` and the rest were second
   names for a base token or a theme key, and the sweep spent them. Write the
   shadcn name (`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`) or the theme key
   (`bg-element-hover`, `text-disabled`). Do not add a synonym for either.

## Type

Nine steps (decision 24). Half-pixel sizes — the audit found ~130 of them —
round **up** to the next step.

| utility | px | line-height | typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `text-3xs` | 9 | 12 | a badge on a dense row |
| `text-2xs` | 10 | 14 | eyebrows, captions, keycaps |
| `text-xs` | 11 | 15 | control text; the most common size in Atlas |
| `text-sm` | 12 | 16 | list rows, secondary chrome |
| `text-base` | 13 | 18 | body text, chat messages |
| `text-md` | 14 | 20 | panel and dialog titles |
| `text-lg` | 16 | 22 | page headings |
| `text-xl` | 20 | 26 | empty-state headlines |
| `text-2xl` | 24 | 30 | the largest thing in the app |

**Two weights only**: `font-medium` (500) and `font-semibold` (600). Nothing
lighter, nothing heavier — the app is a dense monochrome UI and 400 disappears
against it.

### Named text styles

Six `@utility` classes. Reach for one of these *before* reaching for a size plus
a weight plus a colour — that combination is how the 1,335 arbitrary sizes got
there.

| utility | what it is |
|---|---|
| `eyebrow` | the section header above a group of rows — 10px, 600, uppercase, tracked |
| `label` | the text on and beside a control — 11px, 500 |
| `body` | running prose: a description, a message — 13px, 500 |
| `caption` | the dimmed second line under something — 10px, 500, muted |
| `code` | any monospace run: a path, a hash, a command — 12px, 500 |
| `heading` | a panel or dialog title — 14px, 600 |

## Control heights

Four steps (decision 25). The heights the audit found at 22, 28 and 30 snap to
the nearest step.

| utility | px | use |
|---|---|---|
| `h-control-xs` | 20 | inline chip, keycap |
| `h-control-sm` | 24 | dense toolbar control |
| `h-control-md` | 26 | **the default control** |
| `h-control-lg` | 32 | primary action, search field |

`size-control-xs … size-control-lg` give the same value on both axes, for an
icon-only control.

Two named layout constants, which are **not** controls and are not on the scale:
`h-titlebar` (30px) and `h-tab-strip` (36px, the centre tab strip).

## Radius

Derived from the theme's `--radius` (decision 26), so one number in a theme file
moves the whole scale:

```
sm = r − 4    md = r − 2    lg = r    xl = r + 4    full = 9999px
```

| utility | use |
|---|---|
| `rounded` | alias of `rounded-sm` — bare `rounded` is the control radius |
| `rounded-sm` | controls: buttons, inputs, keycaps |
| `rounded-md` | cards and rows |
| `rounded-lg` | popovers and menus |
| `rounded-xl` | dialogs |
| `rounded-full` | pills and avatars |

Rendered today: **4 / 6 / 8 / 12**. Before Foundations it was 2 / 4 / 6 with no
`xl`, and bare `rounded` was 4px. Two things to know:

- **Bare `rounded` changed.** Tailwind's own `rounded` is a static `0.25rem`
  that no theme value can reach, so `globals.css` redeclares it in the utilities
  layer, after the generated rules. It therefore beats `.rounded` and still
  loses to `.rounded-lg` on an element carrying both.
- **The scale reads `--radius-base`, which is now plain `var(--radius)`.** It
  briefly carried a `max(…, 8px)` floor: Atlas sets its root font-size to 13px
  (`globals.css`, `@layer base`), so a `rem` here is 13px, and every built-in
  theme file shipped `radius = "0.375rem"` — 4.875px, with `r − 4px` collapsing
  to 0.875px, i.e. square everywhere whatever the theme asked for. The theme
  files now ship `radius = "8px"`, the floor is gone, and a theme that wants to
  be **squarer** than 8px finally can be. A theme file is the only place the
  scale is set; do not reintroduce a floor.

## Elevation

Three levels (decision 27). The shadow **colour comes from the theme**: each
level points at one of the theme's shadcn `--shadow-*` tokens through an
`--elevation-*` variable in `tokens.css`. A theme's `[light.base]` and
`[dark.base]` tables set their own `--shadow-*` ramps independently — a light
appearance is not the dark ramp reused as-is. Pure black at the dark table's
alphas reads as a heavy halo on a light surface, so a light ramp should tint
from the theme's own light-appearance foreground (or another dark-enough base
colour) at a much lower alpha instead.

| utility | level |
|---|---|
| `shadow-sm` | raised off the surface |
| `shadow-md` | menus and popovers |
| `shadow-lg` | dialogs |

`shadow-xl` and `shadow-2xl` are pointed at the dialog level as well, because
left alone they render Tailwind's 10%-black default, which is invisible on
Atlas's near-black chrome. Do not introduce a fourth level.

Two more utilities belong here:

- `inset-highlight` — the 1px top edge on raised glass. It delegates to
  Tailwind's own inset-shadow utility, so `inset-highlight shadow-md` composes
  instead of one replacing the other. Its colour is the `element.highlight`
  theme key — the theme's foreground at 6% — so a light variant gets a dark
  edge instead of the white-on-white one a hardcoded highlight would give it.
- `backdrop-blur-glass` — the one glass blur (`--blur-glass`, 24px).
- `glass-hud` — the frosted HUD: a hairline border, the raised top edge and the
  menu-rung shadow, for a surface that floats over whatever the app is showing
  (the hint-nav keycaps and their dock, the sign-in dock). Compose the blur and
  the translucent fill with it —
  `glass-hud backdrop-blur-glass bg-gradient-to-b from-popover/85 to-card/90` —
  because the alpha is what lets the blur through and a smaller chip may want a
  lighter one.

One thing to keep in mind:

- **`shadow-md` is pinned to the theme's `--shadow-2xl`**, which is what the
  former `--shadow-overlay` alias rendered, so the sweep replaced all of its
  call sites with `shadow-md` and moved nothing. Do not repoint it.
  `shadow-lg` stacks the theme's `--shadow-xl` under its `--shadow-2xl` to get
  a rung of its own — the shadcn scale has no fourth step, and `md` and `lg`
  resolving to the same value made every dialog read as a popover.

## The scrim

Two utilities, and the colour is **deliberately not a theme key**.

| utility | what it is |
|---|---|
| `scrim` | a dialog, a command palette, a lightbox — the app behind is out of reach |
| `scrim-soft` | an in-panel drawer whose own surface carries the depth |

The decision, because it looks like an omission: a scrim's whole job is to push
what is behind it away from the reader, and only *darkening* does that. Over a
light theme a light scrim separates nothing. Every light UI worth copying
darkens — macOS sheets, VS Code light, and shadcn's own `DialogOverlay`, which
is a bare `bg-black/50` in both appearances and is not a token there either.
Making it a key would offer a theme author a choice with one correct answer, and
the wrong answer would silently switch the dim off. Appearance is carried by the
alpha instead: 60% black reads as a heavy dim on cream and as a deepening on
near-black, which is the same instruction in both.

What *was* drift is that 29 sites wrote nine different alphas by hand
(`bg-black/10` through `/80`). Those two utilities are now the whole vocabulary,
and `scrim` is also the right fill for a control that sits over arbitrary media
— a user's photo, a PDF page — for the same reason: nothing about the theme
tells you what is underneath.

**The mirror of this is `bg-white/[0.06]`, and that one is not invariant.** A
white hairline or a white wash is the *dark*-appearance reading of "this surface
catches the light"; on cream it is nothing at all. Those 49 sites moved onto the
element roles — `bg-element-hover` / `-selected` / `-active`,
`border-border-subtle` / `-border` / `-border-strong` — which are the theme's own
foreground at an alpha and therefore flip with the appearance.

Three literals survive on purpose, all of them decision 3's documented
exceptions: the PDF page (paper is white), the lightbox matte behind someone
else's photo, and the Windows close button's system red in the titlebar.

## Z-index

Nine named layers (decision 28). Nothing outside `globals.css` writes a
z-index — not a class, not an inline style.

| utility | value | what sits there |
|---|---|---|
| `z-panel` | 10 | in-panel stacking: sticky headers, resize handles |
| `z-titlebar` | 40 | the titlebar and its dock |
| `z-drawer` | 60 | a panel that slides over the chrome: the project rail, the notification drawer |
| `z-overlay` | 100 | a dialog's scrim |
| `z-modal` | 110 | the dialog itself |
| `z-popover` | 200 | menus, popovers, comboboxes |
| `z-toast` | 300 | toasts |
| `z-tooltip` | 400 | tooltips |
| `z-drag` | 500 | whatever is under the cursor mid-drag |

`popover` sits **above** `modal` deliberately: a menu opened inside a dialog has
to escape it. That is the ordering bug the audit found, where everything shared
9999.

`drawer` was the band nothing named. A drawer has to clear the titlebar and has
to lose to a dialog, so the project rail wrote `z-[55]`/`z-[60]` and the
notification drawer wrote `z-[9998]`/`z-[9999]` — two answers to one question,
and the second one put a dismissible drawer above every modal in the app. **A
drawer's own scrim is an earlier sibling on the same layer**, not a layer of its
own: they share a stacking context, so document order already puts the panel
above its dim, and `overlay`/`modal` stay the dialog's pair.

## Motion

Four durations and exactly three easing curves (decision 29). No new curve gets
added without a decision.

| utility | value | |
|---|---|---|
| `duration-instant` | 80ms | a state flip the user should not perceive as motion |
| `duration-fast` | 120ms | hover and focus transitions |
| `duration-base` | 180ms | the default: menus, popovers, tabs |
| `duration-slow` | 260ms | panels and drawers travelling a long way |

| easing | use |
|---|---|
| `ease-out-strong` | entrances; the default |
| `ease-in-out-strong` | two-way state changes |
| `ease-drawer` | panels and drawers sliding in |

`src/ui/tooltip-timing.ts` is the model for a component that needs more than a
duration — a shared open delay, a warm-start window, reduced-motion handling.
Copy its shape rather than scattering timers.

## Icons

One wrapper: `src/ui/icon.tsx` (decision 30).

```tsx
import { Search } from "lucide-react";
import { Icon } from "@/ui/icon";

<Icon icon={Search} size="sm" />;
```

Five sizes — `xs` 10, `sm` 12, `md` 14 (the default), `lg` 16, `xl` 20 — and one
stroke width, **1.75**. Lucide's own default of 2 reads heavy at these sizes.

**Not done yet, and deliberately.** ~960 `size={n}` call sites remain, 443 of
them off the scale (`11` × 308, `13` × 110, `9` × 23, `15` × 22, `18` × 17,
`8` × 8). The colour-and-scale sweep left them: unlike a token swap, moving a
site means restructuring the element — `<Plus size={14} />` becomes
`<Icon icon={Plus} size="md" />` — and the ratchet cannot see the result, so a
scattered half-migration would be invisible to everything but a reader. When it
is done, it is one pass with this mapping:

```
8 → 10 (xs)   9 → 10 (xs)   10 → 10 (xs)   11 → 12 (sm)   12 → 12 (sm)
13 → 14 (md)  14 → 14 (md)  15 → 16 (lg)   16 → 16 (lg)   18 → 20 (xl)   20 → 20 (xl)
```

Note that `11 → 12` moves the single most common icon size in the app, in dense
chrome sized around it, so it wants the before/after check on
`?scenario=design-system` that decision 23 asks for. Foundations shipped the
wrapper and uses it in the `src/ui` primitives only.

## States

**Focus** (decision 31). There is one keyboard focus indicator: a 2px
`var(--ring)` outline on `:focus-visible`, offset 1px, declared in `@layer base`
in `globals.css`. `:focus` stays bare, so a mouse click never draws a ring and a
`role="tab"` host never looks stuck.

A control that draws its own indicator opts out with `focus-ring-none` (or
Tailwind's `focus-visible:outline-none`). Both are utilities, which is why the
global rule has to live in `@layer base` — an unlayered rule would outrank every
utility regardless of specificity.

`--ring` is a real accent: every built-in theme sets it to its `primary`, and the
pre-theme fallback in `tokens.css` matches. It used to equal `--border-strong`,
which is why a focus ring was indistinguishable from a border.

**Disabled** (decision 31). One visual treatment, everywhere: `opacity-50` plus
`cursor-not-allowed`. `Button` and `IconButton` key it off Base UI's
`data-disabled` attribute (`data-disabled:opacity-50 data-disabled:cursor-not-allowed`)
rather than the `:disabled` pseudo-class, since `data-disabled` is present
whether or not the control also carries the native `disabled` attribute — see
`focusableWhenDisabled` below. Every other `src/ui` primitive, which renders a
plain element rather than Base UI's `Button`, still carries the same pair as
`disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed`. For an element that cannot
take `:disabled` at all — a `div` acting as a control — use the `disabled-look`
utility. Do not invent a third opacity; the audit found five (30 / 40 / 45 /
50 / 60).

## Primitives

`src/ui/` (decision 32). Variants come from `class-variance-authority`, which is
the only dependency Foundations added.

Each file is shaped like shadcn's **base-style** component — same file name, same
exported `<name>Variants`, same `variant` / `size` prop pair, same `data-slot` —
so later `shadcn add` output drops in with the classes swapped rather than the
structure rewritten. Two deliberate departures:

- **Sizes are Atlas control heights**, not shadcn's 32/36/40px.
- **No `asChild` on `Button`.** shadcn's buttons lean on a Slot primitive;
  `Button` and `IconButton` are built directly on `@base-ui/react/button`
  instead and take its own `render` prop — `<Button render={<a href="/x" />}>`
  composes the element, with props merged by Base UI rather than cloned by a
  Slot. `render` is meant for composing with *other components* (a
  Dialog/Menu/Popover trigger, most often — see `DialogClose` in
  `dialog.tsx`, which renders as an `IconButton`); a plain link that should
  merely *look* like a button is still styled directly —
  `<a className={buttonVariants({ variant: "ghost" })}>` — since a link has
  its own keyboard semantics that Button's `role="button"` handling isn't
  meant to replace (this is also Base UI's own guidance).

`Button` and `IconButton` also take `focusableWhenDisabled` (Base UI's own
prop, default `false`, unchanged from Base UI's default). A disabled control
is out of the tab order unless a call site opts in. Reach for it specifically
where a disabled control also carries a `Hint`/`Tooltip` explaining *why* it
is disabled — otherwise the tooltip can never be reached by keyboard. Most
disabled controls in Atlas explain nothing, so the default stays `false`
rather than flipping every disabled control into the tab order; see the
`IconButton` gallery section (`?scenario=design-system`) for the three states
side by side.

| primitive | reach for it when |
|---|---|
| `Button` | the control has a visible text label. Six variants: `default`, `destructive`, `outline`, `secondary`, `ghost`, `link`. `md` (26px) is the default size. |
| `IconButton` | the control is a glyph and nothing else. `label` is **required** and becomes the `aria-label`; wrap it in `Tooltip` to show the same string. The square is a control height and the glyph is one step below it. |
| `Input` | a single-line text field. It keeps the global focus ring and lifts its border to `--border-focus`. For a secret, `SecretInput` already wraps it. |
| `Badge` | a short status word. Seven variants, four of them the status roles (`destructive`, `success`, `warning`, `info`). Not a control, so not on the control-height scale. |
| `Kbd` | the content is a keystroke. `KbdCombo combo="⌘⇧F"` and `KbdKeys keys={[…]}` are the two forms the app uses. |
| `Tooltip` / `Hint` | a hint for an icon-only control. `Hint` is the one-liner; `Tooltip`/`TooltipTrigger`/`TooltipContent` is the composed form. Timing comes from `tooltip-timing.ts`, not from the library. |
| `Dialog` | a centred modal. `DialogOverlay` is the scrim (Base UI calls it the Backdrop), `DialogContent` the panel. No Positioner — a centred modal places itself. |
| `Popover` | anchored content that is not a list of commands. |
| `DropdownMenu` | a list of commands anchored to a trigger. Base UI has no "DropdownMenu": a trigger-anchored menu *is* `Menu`, and the wrapper renames it back. |
| `ContextMenu` | the same list, opened by right-click at the pointer. |

Those five overlay primitives arrived with the Base UI migration (decision 16).
Three rules they all share, because Base UI's anatomy differs from Radix's:

- **`Portal > Positioner > Popup`** for anything anchored (popover, both menus,
  tooltip). A centred dialog has no Positioner.
- **Positioning props belong to the Positioner.** Each wrapper *declares*
  `side` / `sideOffset` / `align` / `alignOffset` and *forwards* them. Left in
  `...props` they land on the Popup, and positioning silently stops working —
  no type error, no lint error.
- **The z-index belongs to the Positioner too.** The Popup is statically
  positioned inside it, so `z-popover` on the Popup would do nothing at all.
  `z-popover` (200) sits above `z-modal` (110) so a menu opened inside a dialog
  escapes it.

`@base-ui/react` is the only dependency the migration added, and the five
`@radix-ui/*` packages were removed with it. `components.json` names the
`base-nova` style, so a future `shadcn add` delivers Base UI variants rather
than Radix ones — its classes still need swapping for house tokens.

Hover colour comes from real tokens (`bg-primary-hover`), never from a `/90`
opacity modifier — but on **token** grounds, not browser-support ones: a hover
colour is one of the things a theme author should be able to choose, and an
opacity modifier takes that away. (The support claim this paragraph used to make
was wrong: Tailwind v4 emits its `/N` modifiers as an rgba fallback plus an
`@supports (color:color-mix(in lab, red, red))` upgrade — verified against the
built stylesheet, where all 195 `color-mix()` calls sit inside that guard. See
"Colour functions" below.)

## Colour functions

**`color-mix()` is allowed at a call site. Relative colour syntax is not, and
theme resolution never happens in CSS.**

Decision 14 and ADR-0009 originally read as a blanket ban on `color-mix()`,
justified by "Atlas's minimum is macOS 11". The evidence does not support that
version argument, and the ADR's *other* argument is the load-bearing one:

- `color-mix()` needs Safari **16.2**; relative colour syntax (`rgb(from …)`)
  needs **16.4**. ADR-0009's rejection bullet cited the 16.4 number against
  both.
- The shipped stylesheet already contains **71 unconditional `@property`
  at-rules**, emitted by Tailwind v4 itself, and `@property` needs Safari 16.4.
  Tailwind v4's own documented floor is Safari 16.4 / Chrome 111 / Firefox 128.
  Banning `color-mix()` on a 16.2 argument while the utility layer requires 16.4
  buys nothing.
- macOS 11 Big Sur's terminal Safari is 16.6.1, above both. `minimumSystemVersion
  = 11.0` therefore does **not** imply a pre-`color-mix()` WKWebView; only a Big
  Sur install that stopped taking Safari updates does, and that install already
  renders Tailwind v4 degraded whatever this rule says.
- The argument that *does* survive is version-independent: resolution must
  happen in TypeScript because the resolved map has to feed xterm, both pixi
  graphs, recharts and CodeMirror, which need concrete colour values and cannot
  read a custom property. That is about the **resolver**, not about whether a
  stylesheet may tint an already-resolved token at a call site.

So the rule is drawn where the real constraint is:

| | |
|---|---|
| A theme key derived in CSS | **Never.** `keys.toml` + the TS resolver is the one derivation site (decision 42). |
| `color-mix()` tinting a resolved token in a rule or a style prop | Fine. 23 sites do, all of them `var(--token) N%, transparent`. |
| Tailwind's `/N` opacity modifier | Fine — the build emits an rgba fallback and an `@supports` upgrade. |
| Relative colour syntax (`rgb(from …)`, `oklch(from …)`) | **Never.** Safari 16.4, no fallback, and the `colour-literal` ratchet rule already catches it. |

The alternative — replacing the 23 call sites — was rejected: each is a
presentational tint, so it would mean either ~15 new public theme keys (days
after the key-set audit cut 135 to 73 precisely because zero-consumer keys are a
liability) or 23 new TS-resolved values each needing its own theme subscription,
i.e. 23 new chances for a stale palette. Both are worse than the risk removed.

## The ratchet

`tests/design-system-ratchet.test.ts` is one of the contract suites in `tests/`.
Nothing else in the toolchain can see this drift — a new `text-[11.5px]`
type-checks, lints and renders.

**What it counts**, across `src/features/**`, `src/components/**`, `src/ui/**`
and `src/dev/**`:

| rule | pattern |
|---|---|
| `arbitrary-text-size` | `text-[…px]` and friends |
| `arbitrary-z-index` | `z-[…]` |
| `arbitrary-shadow` | `shadow-[…]` |
| `arbitrary-radius` | `rounded-[…]`, any corner |
| `colour-literal` | `#rrggbb`, `rgb(`, `rgba(`, `hsl(`, `hsla(` |
| `white-black-utility` | `white`/`black` after any colour utility prefix, opacity modifier or not |
| `tailwind-palette` | Tailwind's stock ramps — `bg-amber-500`, `text-red-400`, … |
| `bare-z-index` | a bare `z-50` or higher; below 50 is local stacking |
| `inline-numeric-style` | inline `zIndex:`, `fontSize:`, `boxShadow:` with a literal |

`src/styles` is the only wholesale exclusion — it *is* the scale.

`src/ui` and `src/dev` used to be excluded too, on the same "they define these
values" argument, and it was untrue of nearly every file in them: the 2026-09-18
review found a hardcoded white canvas ink and a literal 50%-black popover shadow
sitting in `src/ui`, where exactly 2 of 19 files carried a violation and neither
defined anything. `src/dev` keeps one narrow **directory** exemption, for the
mock fixtures whose colours ARE their content (theme files, and the text of fake
source files the editor renders rather than applies).

Two rules cover what the numeric bans could not. `white-black-utility` replaced
a `bg-`-only rule that let thirteen `text-white` / `border-black/20` sites
through. `bare-z-index` exists because decision 28's "arbitrary z-index ≥ 60" is
a numeric test for a semantic defect: three dialogs shipped at `z-50`, under
their own `z-overlay` (100) scrim, and passed it.

**It is closed.** It ran as a ratchet through the sweep — committed counts in a
baseline file that could only go down — and the sweep drove **every rule to
zero**. The baseline file is gone and the assertions are `=== 0`, so a new
violation fails outright rather than being absorbed.

Which means the exits have to be real ones:

- **`EXEMPT_FILES`** — a whole file, with the argument written next to the path.
  Two shapes qualify: the file *defines* the scale (`theme-key-registry.ts`,
  `color.ts`), or the colour is *not Atlas's to choose* — a third party's brand
  mark (`agent-brand.ts`, `agent-icons.tsx`), a palette the **user** picks a
  value from (spaces sticky notes, knowledge covers, PDF ink), or something that
  has to survive being shown over content Atlas did not draw.
- **`EXEMPT_DIRS`** — the same bar, for a directory. One shape qualifies: the
  files' colours *are* their content.
- **`ratchet-allow: <reason>`** — one site inside an otherwise ordinary file.
  Put it in a comment on the line, or anywhere in the comment block directly
  above it. The rest of the file keeps being scanned, which a whole-file entry
  gives up.

Both demand prose and both are checked: a marker with under 20 characters of
reason, or an exempt file with under 40, fails the suite on its own. That is the
point — the record of *why* is the thing being enforced, not the count.

What survives today, so the shape is clear: the vendors' agent marks, the
user-pickable palettes (spaces, knowledge covers, PDF ink), the colour resolver
and its fixtures, the ANSI `rgb()` string builder in the terminal, the
post-crash error boundary, per-identity avatar hues, pixi's numeric `fontSize`,
mermaid's own `themeVariables`, the PDF page and the lightbox matte (decision
3), Windows' close-button red, and the dev-build badge.
