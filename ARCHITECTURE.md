# Atlas architecture

Deep technical reference for Atlas. The README has the pitch and feature list; this has the file paths and invariants.

Atlas is a Tauri v2 desktop app: a React 19 frontend talking to a Rust backend over IPC. Almost every real feature crosses the whole stack:

```
src/features/<feature>/components  →  stores (Zustand)  →  lib/*-api.ts (invoke + listen)
                                                                 ↓
                                            src-tauri/src/commands/<domain>.rs
                                                                 ↓
                                                        crates/atlas-*
```

- **The frontend never touches the filesystem or spawns processes.** Everything goes through `invoke()` and `listen()`.
- **Rust owns the heavy, stateful subsystems** — agent sessions, the terminal PTY. The stores that mirror them stay thin.

## Frontend (`src/`)

Organized by **feature**, not file type:

```
src/features/<feature>/
  components/   — React components
  stores/       — Zustand store(s) for this feature
  lib/          — pure helpers, and the invoke()/listen() wrappers (<domain>-api.ts)
```

`src/features/` holds ~30 slices: app, chat, editor, terminal, browser, git, github, explorer, knowledge, canvas, layout, log, monitor, settings, memory, mission-control, model-chat, organisations, packs, projects, skills, telemetry, updater, and more.

- **Cross-feature widgets** live in `src/components/`.
- **UI primitives** live in `src/ui/`.
- **Shared helpers** live in `src/lib/`. `@/` aliases `src/`.

### State management

- **Stores are Zustand + Immer**, wrapped in `createSelectors` (`src/lib/create-selectors.ts`), which auto-generates `useStore.use.x()` selectors.
- **Stores never call other stores directly.** Cross-feature coordination happens by reading another feature's state via `getState()` at an action boundary, or by firing `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("atlas:..."))` for looser coupling. Importing one feature's store into another feature's store module violates this.
- **Tailwind classes compose through `cn()`** (`src/lib/utils.ts`), never concatenated ad hoc.

### The authoritative-state boundary

**Rust — or a native browser API — owns state for every subsystem where performance matters.** The matching Zustand store holds only UI metadata and mirrored deltas.

| Subsystem | Store holds (UI only) | Real state lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Chat | queues, draft text, scroll position (`chat/stores/chat-store.ts`) | the ported thread behind `AgentConnection` — message log, tool calls, run status, projected to the session-delta wire and streamed over `atlas:agents` |
| Editor | open-file metadata, dirty flags (`editor/stores/editor-store.ts`) | CodeMirror owns the document text |
| Terminal | split/pane layout (`terminal/stores/terminal-store.ts`) | `atlas-terminal`'s PTY session owns the byte buffer |

This is a deliberate performance boundary, not an oversight to fix by moving more state into the store. Lifting chat messages, document text, or terminal bytes into Zustand degrades streaming, typing, and PTY throughput — every keystroke would touch Immer.

Other stores: `project/stores/project-store.ts` (current project, recents), `git/stores/git-store.ts` (branch, status, lane-assigned commit graph), `log/stores/log-store.ts` (ring-buffered event log, 500 in memory, + on-disk pinned rows), `knowledge/stores/knowledge-store.ts`, `canvas/stores/canvas-store.ts` (ReactFlow nodes/edges), `monitor/stores/usage-store.ts` (token usage per provider/model).

### Tabs and the split-column layout

`layout/stores/layout-store.ts` owns the tab system:

- `addTab` / `closeTab`, per-tab-type dedupe rules.
- **Up to 3 columns** (`groupOrder`, capped at 3). Each tab carries a `groupId` naming its column.
- A maintained `activeTabId` mirrors the focused column's active tab, so most readers don't need to know splits exist.

`src/lib/constants.ts` holds `TAB_TYPES` (the tab-type registry); `src/features/layout/components/center-panel.tsx` holds the lazy-import map keyed off it. New panel type = lazy import in `center-panel.tsx` + entry in `TAB_TYPES` + entry in `NEW_TAB_OPTIONS` if it should reach the `+` menu.

**Persistent module types — editor, terminal, browser, knowledge-graph, pdf — stay mounted across tab switches** via `display: contents` / `display: none` instead of unmounting. Remounting would rebuild CodeMirror instances, kill the PTY's rendered scrollback, or tear down the native embedded webview.

## Backend (`src-tauri/src/`)

One Rust module per IPC domain under `src-tauri/src/commands/`. `commands/mod.rs` declares 70 `pub mod` domain files:

| Domain group | Modules |
|---|---|
| Agents (ported ACP stack) | agents, agent_host, agent_transcript, agent_analytics, agent_memory, catalog, registry, capture, artifacts_cloud |
| Agent tool servers | memory_server (ADR-0010), ui_server (ADR-0012) |
| Terminal / browser / fs | terminal, browser, fs |
| Git | git, git_graph, git_watcher, git_autofetch, gitdiff, git_ops, git_conflicts, git_snapshot, git_stage_ops |
| GitHub | github |
| Knowledge | knowledge, knowledge_meta, knowledge_links, knowledge_export, knowledge_graph_layout |
| Memory | memory_* — graph, pack, policy, sharing, summarize, timeline, delta, inject, compile, indexer, retrieve; plus shared_memory, instruction_sync |
| Models & usage | models, models_pricing, usage, tool_stats |
| Session chat | session_chat, session_chat_sessions, modelchat |
| Auth & environment | auth, byok, shell_profile, mcp |
| Other | app_state, canvas, cli, clipboard, codebase_index, compose_prompt, feedback, fileindex, log, mention_search, mission_control, pdf_annotations, plans, project_session, recent_files, search, skills, telemetry, updater, window |

Adding a command is a three-edit rule:

1. **Write the fn.** `#[tauri::command]` in `commands/<domain>.rs`.
2. **Declare the module.** `pub mod <domain>;` in `commands/mod.rs` (new files only).
3. **Register the handler.** Add the fn to `tauri::generate_handler![]` in `lib.rs`.

Miss any of the three and the command either fails to compile or silently 404s from the frontend's `invoke()`.

**Every blocking operation must run inside `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`** — `Command::output`/`Command::spawn`, file I/O over large trees, git subprocess calls, anything not already `async`. The Tauri command runtime is shared with the UI's IPC channel; a blocking call there stalls every other in-flight command and freezes the UI.

### Event channels

Streaming from Rust to the UI runs on Tauri events, `atlas:*` channels, most payload-typed by a `kind` field rather than one channel per message shape.

| Channel | Carries |
|---|---|
| `atlas:agents` | every agent delta — message append, content-block delta, tool call, permission request, status, error, done |
| `atlas:threads-changed` | thread-metadata store changed; the sidebar's only refresh signal |
| `atlas:capture-changed` | Timeline / checkpoint record updated — local capture **and** a remote board refresh |
| `atlas:artifacts-cloud` | Timeline cloud deltas: entry upsert, comment upsert, presence, membership revoked, resync |
| `atlas:agent-elicitation`, `atlas:agent-elicitation-resolved` | agent-initiated prompts to the user |
| `atlas:ui-action` | one UI action from Atlas Agent's UI tool server, for the window to perform and answer through `ui_action_respond` (ADR-0012) |
| `atlas:org-action` | the audit record of one organisation tool call (refusals and failures too), for the window that shows the session to write its Logs row (ADR-0014) |
| `atlas:org-window-action` | one organisation tool call the window performs (drawing on a Space page), on the UI action's wire and answered through `ui_action_respond` (ADR-0014) |
| `atlas:agent-catalog:changed`, `atlas:registry-install:progress` | Marketplace catalog and install progress |
| `atlas:auth-run:progress` / `:done` | interactive agent sign-in run |
| `atlas:modelchat` | model-chat streaming |
| `atlas:browser-nav` | embedded-webview navigation state |
| `atlas:git-changed`, `atlas:git-status-fresh`, `atlas:git:op` | git state invalidation from the fs-watcher, and long-op progress |
| `atlas:codebase-index:progress` | codebase-index build progress |
| `atlas:update-checking` / `-available` / `-progress` / `-ready` / `-applied` / `-error` | auto-updater lifecycle |
| `atlas:auth-changed` / `-signed-out` / `-error` | account/session state |
| `atlas:byok-env-updated` | shell-profile API-key environment changed |
| `atlas:recent-files-changed`, `atlas:models-changed`, `atlas:models-pricing-updated` | cache-invalidation broadcasts |
| `atlas:cli-open-project`, `atlas:close-active-tab` | native menu / single-instance-relaunch plumbing |
| `atlas:explorer:changed`, `atlas:fileindex:updated` | file-tree and file-index invalidation |
| `atlas:knowledge:links-changed`, `atlas:knowledge:meta-changed` | knowledge-base backlink and metadata updates |
| `atlas:model-download:*`, `atlas:memory-embed:*` | local model download and embedding progress |

## Agent runtime

Atlas's agent stack is a port of Zed's, taken as a mechanism rather than rewritten. Two kinds of agent run behind one seam: the **native agent** — Atlas's own engine, a hard fork vendored under `vendor/atlas-engine` and reached through `crates/atlas-native-agent` (ADR-0003, ADR-0011), running in-process — and any number of **external ACP agents** — subprocesses speaking Agent Client Protocol (JSON-RPC over stdio). Nothing above the seam knows which it is talking to.

**A fresh install has no ACP agents at all.** Only the native agent is offered. An external agent exists exactly when the user installed it from the Marketplace, which writes the single entry in the installed-agents map; nothing else makes an agent runnable. Finding a binary on `PATH` is a *detection* — an offer the user can accept, never a spawn candidate. See [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-no-default-acp-agents.md).

### The seam: `AgentConnection`

`AgentConnection` (`crates/atlas-acp-thread/src/connection.rs`) is the trait every agent implements — one live connection, with turns driven through `prompt`.

| Implementation | Crate | Drives |
|---|---|---|
| external ACP agent | `atlas-agent-servers` | a subprocess over JSON-RPC/stdio |
| native agent | `atlas-native-agent` | the vendored `atlas-engine`, in-process |

Beyond `prompt` / `cancel` / `authenticate`, **every optional behaviour is capability-gated** — either a `supports_*` predicate (`supports_load_session`, `supports_resume_session`, `supports_close_session`, `supports_logout`, `supports_http_mcp`) or an `Option<Arc<dyn …>>` sub-trait the connection returns only when the agent advertised it (`model_selector`, `session_modes`, `session_config_options`, `session_list`, `truncate`, `retry`, `set_title`, `telemetry`). A caller asks the connection what it can do; it never asks who it is.

**Branching on agent identity is forbidden.** Capabilities come from what the agent advertised at `initialize`. An `if agent_id == "claude"` is a bug, not a shortcut — it is what made the pre-port stack impossible to extend to an agent nobody had hand-written support for.

### Manager, host, and the delta projection

Three layers sit between the connection and the IPC surface:

- **`AgentManager`** (`crates/atlas-agent-manager`) owns who is connected and which sessions are open on them — ported from Zed's `AgentConnectionStore`. Three behaviours worth knowing: a second connect request while the first is still connecting *joins* it rather than starting a second process; a failed connection does not stick (the entry records the error for waiters, then goes, so the next request retries instead of replaying the failure forever); and a version bump drops the connection, because the running process is on the old binary. Every eviction path also forgets that agent's sessions and cancels any connect still in flight — a session pins the connection `Arc`, so one left behind keeps a child alive that nothing, including the shutdown sweep, can reach.
- **`AgentHost`** (`src-tauri/src/commands/agent_host.rs`) is what `commands/agents.rs` talks to. It holds the three things the ported stack deliberately does not do: the **identity map** between the frontend's per-spawn `AgentId`/`SessionKey` and the manager's own keys, the **history** row kept current in the thread-metadata store, and cheap **session metadata** (`snapshot_meta`) on the send path.
- **`DeltaProjector`** (`crates/atlas-agent-delta`) turns thread events into the wire the rest of Atlas consumes.

### The session-delta wire

Every delta travels an ordered `OutboundPipeline` (`atlas-bus`) of independent middleware: `BroadcastMiddleware` (the `atlas:agents` window event), `CaptureMiddleware` (Timeline + the permanent checkpoint record), `AnalyticsMiddleware`, `TranscriptMiddleware`, `MemoryIngestMiddleware`.

The `SessionDelta` shapes those consumers pattern-match live in **`crates/atlas-agent-wire`** and are **additive-only**: consumers match concrete variants and fields, so adding an optional field or variant is ordinary work (same change as its consumers, plus the contract tests), while renaming or removing one, or changing a field's meaning, is a breaking change that updates every consumer at once. `crates/atlas-agent-wire/tests/contract.rs` (Rust) and `tests/wire-shape-contract.test.ts` (TS) are the authority: they spell the contract out and fail if the wire drifts from it. (`docs/agents/delta-wire-contract.md` is a git-ignored working note; the tests do not rely on it.) The thread model and the wire disagree about what a "message" is — the thread keeps one entry per assistant message with interleaved text and thought chunks; the wire emits one message per contiguous run of a kind — and reconciling that gap is precisely `atlas-agent-delta`'s job.

### Atlas's tool servers

Atlas hands agents three in-process MCP services on one loopback listener, behind one bearer token per session: the **memory tool server** (`memory_server/`, `/mcp`, ADR-0010), offered to every agent that advertises HTTP MCP, the **UI tool server** (`ui_server/`, `/ui`, ADR-0012), offered only to a connection that carries **UI control** — today the in-process native connection — and the **organisation tool server** (below). One offer (`MemorySessionOffers`) decides all three, because the token table holds one token per session. A UI tool call crosses to the window as `atlas:ui-action`; the frontend performs it through the app's own openers (`src/features/ui-actions/`) and answers through `ui_action_respond`, so Rust mirrors no layout or focus state. `tests/ui-actions-contract.test.ts` keeps the tool list and the window's dispatcher in step.

### The organisation tool server

The **organisation tool server** (`org_server/`, `/org`, `atlas_org`, ADR-0014) lets Atlas Agent read the organisation a Project belongs to — members, conversations, the inbox, recorded sessions and their comments — and act in it as the signed-in user. It is offered only to a connection that carries **organisation access** (`org_access` on the session request, the same kind of connection property as UI control, never an agent id), while the setting "Let Atlas Agent act in your organisation" is on, someone is signed in, and the session's Project is bound to a Workspace. The offer resolves the Project's binding into an `OrgScope` (organisation + Workspace) stamped on the session's grant; the tools act in that organisation — in that Workspace unless a tool names another of the organisation's, whose server then decides — and nowhere else, so switching the window's active organisation cannot redirect a turn, and the setting, the sign-in and the binding are re-checked on every call. Every remote operation goes through one trait, the **organisation cloud** (`cloud.rs`, `OrganisationCloud`): the production `AppOrganisationCloud` (`adapter.rs`) wraps the artifacts client, the chat (comms) client and `AuthCore`, which already hold the bearer in Rust; the tests run the real listener against an in-memory `FakeOrganisation`. Admins get one more tool (`org_member_activity`), decided per `tools/list` from the token's role and refused at call time for anyone else. **Outward actions** — `org_comment_reply` and `org_send`, the tools that reach another person — ask first: the offer declares them in its ask-first list, the native seam projects each with a per-tool `Prompt`, the engine asks as an MCP elicitation that the seam serves only for a server Atlas offered the thread (`engine/tool_approvals.rs`), and the approval card shows the recipient and the full body from the host's `describe_call` (`OrgTools::describe`, sharing its argument parsing with the post so the card is what is sent). The seam records each approval per exact call in `OutwardConsent`, and the server posts only a call found there — so a call the engine runs unasked, in bypass mode, is refused and nothing is sent. Drawing on a Space page (`org_page_write`) needs the page codec the frontend holds, so it crosses to the window on the UI tool server's bridge as `atlas:org-window-action` and is answered through `ui_action_respond`. Every call, refusals included, is one `OrgActionRecord` emitted as `atlas:org-action` for the Logs panel. Ambiguity is the model's to resolve: names that match several members or conversations come back as candidates, and the model asks the user through the engine's `request_user_input`, which the native connection serves as a question card mid-turn in every mode (ADR-0013); tool servers themselves never elicit. A composer mention of a member, conversation or recorded session reaches the tools as an `atlas-org://` link carrying the id. `org_server/tests.rs` measures the server's fixed-prefix cost (`docs/research/org-tool-server-prefix.md`).

### `commands/agents.rs`

37 IPC verbs. The session lifecycle (`agents_spawn`, `agents_new_session`, `agents_send`, `agents_cancel`, `agents_kill`), the capability-gated knobs (`agents_set_mode`, `agents_set_model`, `agents_set_effort`, `agents_set_config_option`), permissions and elicitation (`agents_respond_permission`, `agents_respond_elicitation`), auth (`agents_authenticate`, `agents_list_auth_methods`, `agents_run_auth_method`, `agents_logout`), and the history surface (`threads_history`, `threads_resume`, `threads_archive`, `threads_delete`, `threads_projects`, `threads_import`, `threads_import_candidates`).

Deltas return over the single `atlas:agents` channel, payload-typed by `kind`.

### Three invariants

- **Atlas owns its history.** The sidebar reads the app-owned thread-metadata store (`crates/atlas-thread-metadata`, `threads.db`) and nothing else. Atlas does not read any agent CLI's private storage to build history — the per-agent scrape readers were deleted and must not come back. See [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-app-owned-thread-metadata-store.md), and `CONTEXT.md` for the thread/session/draft/archive vocabulary.
- **A thread is not a session.** A *thread* is the conversation Atlas tracks, keyed by an id Atlas mints; it exists before any agent process and outlives one forgetting the session. A *session* is the agent-side conversation, keyed by an ACP session id. A thread references at most one session. Collapsing the two is the mistake the old `acpSessionId`-as-filename design made.
- **Streams are tab-independent.** The projector owns the broadcast, not any UI component — concurrent prompts in several tabs keep streaming regardless of focus. Switching tabs resubscribes; no in-flight state is created, paused, or lost.

**PATH resolution.** macOS strips `PATH` from GUI-launched processes, so a bundled `.app` cannot see a user-installed agent CLI that a terminal in the same account finds fine. `crates/atlas-agent-servers/src/host_env.rs` resolves the real one: a fast guessed pass, then the user's actual login-shell `PATH` via `$SHELL -lc 'echo $PATH'` under a short timeout, because no static guess covers every version manager.

## Crates (`crates/`)

All wired in as `path` dependencies from `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and all members of the **root `[workspace]`** bar one (`atlas-kb-server`, below). The repo went without one for a long time, for a real reason: the ported stack pins `agent-client-protocol` 2.0 with its schema crate pinned exactly, and no single Cargo resolution could hold that alongside the old stack's exact `=1.4.0` pin. That collision is why the port had to land as one change rather than gradually. With the old stack gone the collision is gone, and the workspace landed (issue #38) so the vendored engine resolves against the same graph as the app. Consequences worth knowing: one `Cargo.lock` and one `target/` at the repo root, and `[patch.crates-io]` plus every `[profile.*]` live in the root `Cargo.toml` — cargo honors both only there. `crates/atlas-kb-server` is deliberately excluded (it is built on demand at runtime under its own profile).

### The ported ACP stack

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `atlas-acp-thread` | Port of Zed's `acp_thread`: the agent session model and the `AgentConnection` seam every agent plugs into. Chunk merging by `messageId`, permission prompts surviving concurrent status changes. |
| `atlas-agent-servers` | Port of Zed's `agent_servers`: transport to an external ACP agent and the launcher that starts one. Where the port's reliability lives — connect, initialize, cancel, retry — plus `host_env.rs`'s PATH resolution. |
| `atlas-agent-store` | Port of Zed's agent store: where an external agent comes from and how its command line is resolved. Backs the Marketplace and the installed-agents map. |
| `atlas-agent-manager` | Who is connected, and which sessions are open on them. Ported from Zed's `AgentConnectionStore`, with the session ownership Zed spreads across its per-agent view folded in. |
| `atlas-agent-delta` | Projects ported-thread events into the `SessionDelta` wire. Reconciles the thread's one-entry-per-message model with the wire's one-message-per-contiguous-run model. |
| `atlas-agent-wire` | The additive-only session-delta wire shapes, enforced by `tests/contract.rs`. |
| `atlas-native-agent` | The vendored engine (`vendor/atlas-engine`) on the `AgentConnection` seam — the native agent as just another connection. Its agent id is the literal `"atlas-agent"`: a storage key every thread row resolves through, so renaming it is a data migration (ADR-0011). |
| `atlas-agent-transcript` | Where an agent keeps its record of a conversation, and how to read Atlas's own text back out of one. The Claude JSONL replay it used to hold is gone. |
| `atlas-thread-metadata` | The app-owned thread-metadata store (`threads.db`) — Atlas's only source for the sidebar and history. Metadata only, never transcript content. Ported from Zed's `ThreadMetadataStore`. See ADR-0001. |
| `atlas-bus` | Event broadcaster + middleware pipeline seam: a `tokio::sync::broadcast`-backed fan-out (lagging subscribers drop rather than block the producer), plus `OutboundPipeline`. Generic — no dependency on any agent or ACP type. |

### Everything else

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `atlas-checkpoint` | The agent-session record: local SQLite store (`.atlas/sessions.db`), redact-on-write capture, git commit linkage, transcript import, sync outbox. Tauri-free, so the whole surface is testable against a real database and a real git repo. **Push only** — it drains the outbox to the ingest service and never reads a Session back. |
| `atlas-artifacts` | The Timeline's cloud **read** half: remote Sessions, comments, and one WebSocket per connected cloud Project. Tauri-free, `TokenSource` as the only host seam, shaped on `atlas-comms`. Split from `atlas-checkpoint` because reads need tokio and tungstenite and that crate is deliberately synchronous. The invariant that makes a merged board possible: `rowId` on the wire **is** the local row id, so local and remote rows share one identity and a comment anchor resolves against a local row with no mapping table. |
| `atlas-redact` | Single source of truth for secret redaction: layered scrubbing (Shannon entropy, vendored betterleaks rules, provider prefixes, credentialed URIs, connection strings) with JSON-aware traversal. String in, redacted string out — no I/O, no async. |
| `atlas-git` | Git execution layer: one spawn chokepoint over the real `git` binary (so hooks run), a typed stderr→error taxonomy with friendly messages (ported from GitHub Desktop/dugite), porcelain-v2 status parsing, streaming output for long operations. |
| `atlas-gitdiff` | Structured side-by-side diff engine: parses unified diffs, computes word-level intra-line change spans (word-diff vendored from `dandavison/delta`, MIT). |
| `atlas-terminal` | Wraps `portable-pty`, manages `TerminalSession`s, bridges PTY bytes to Tauri events. |
| `atlas-memory` | On-device RAG/memory engine: MiniLM → usearch HNSW behind a `MemorySearchFn` seam; the shared-memory record store (`record`: SQLite per repository scope, redact-on-write, one-time legacy migration); and global promotion of Facts seen in two or more repositories to `~/.atlas/memory` (`global`). Read its `README.md` and `MIGRATION.md` before changing on-disk index formats. |
| `atlas-instruction-sync` | Mirrors `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` into one marked block of a project's `AGENTS.md`, for agents that read only `AGENTS.md`. Plain file I/O, no async, no Tauri; every byte outside the block is kept, and anything it cannot be sure of is skipped and logged. `commands::instruction_sync` decides when it runs. |
| `atlas-embed` | On-device text embeddings (BERT-family sentence-transformers) and a small vector store, isolated so `candle`'s heavy dependency tree doesn't slow everything else's incremental builds. Embedding only — on-device generation was removed 2026-08-22. |
| `atlas-codeindex` | Deterministic codebase scanner: turns live source into structural, embeddable docs via its own tree-sitter code intelligence (Rust/TS/TSX/JS/Python/Go). |
| `atlas-profile` | Which data this process owns: the default profile or the dev profile `bun run dev:app` runs under. Derived once from the bundle identifier; every `.atlas` and `~/.config/atlas` name goes through it. Names only — no I/O, no dependencies. |
| `atlas-kb-server` | Standalone static-server binary produced by the knowledge base's "Export server" action. Embeds the exported HTML/CSS via `include_dir!`, serves on `localhost:4747`. |

## Persistence

Most app state is plain files, by design — but **three subsystems are SQLite**, and all are Atlas's own databases rather than anyone else's:

| Store | Path | Crate |
|---|---|---|
| Session history (thread metadata) | `<app-config-dir>/threads.db` | `atlas-thread-metadata` |
| Session record / Timeline (checkpoints) | `<project-root>/.atlas/sessions.db` + blob sidecar | `atlas-checkpoint` |
| Shared memory record (events, entries, sessions) | `<scope-root>/.atlas/memory/memory.sqlite` | `atlas-memory` (`record`) |

`<app-config-dir>` is Tauri's `app_config_dir()` — `~/Library/Application Support/dev.atlas.ide/` on macOS. History is global because threads are grouped *across* projects; the checkpoint record is per-project because a Timeline is about one worktree. Shared memory is per *repository*: its scope root is the main worktree (found through the git common dir), or the launch directory outside git, so every worktree of a repository shares one record.

**Atlas does not read another program's storage to build session history.** The per-agent scrape readers are deleted (ADR-0001). Two deliberate reads of CLI directories remain and are not history: the checkpoint importer, under its own preserved contract, and the memory/skills surfaces, which read instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, skills) as documents. `CONTEXT.md` records one flagged exception — the Memory panel's Codex thread list.

Everything else is per-project files under `<project-root>/.atlas/`:

**Profiles.** Every name above belongs to the default profile. `bun run dev:app` builds with `src-tauri/tauri.dev.conf.json` (identifier `dev.atlas.ide.dev`, product name "Atlas Dev"), and `crates/atlas-profile` derives the rest from that identifier at the top of `run()`: `<app-config-dir>` moves with the identifier, `.atlas/` becomes `.atlas-dev/` (in projects and in `~`), and `~/.config/atlas/` becomes `~/.config/atlas-dev/`. One switch, read from the binary rather than the environment, so it cannot half-apply and a child process cannot inherit it; a release build is always the default profile. Other programs' stores (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills`) are not Atlas's and are shared by both; in `~/.agents/skills` the dev profile seeds its bundled skill as `atlas-dev-self-configure`, beside the default profile's `atlas-self-configure` rather than over it. Beyond names, the dev profile changes three behaviours: it keeps `.atlas-dev/` out of git through the repository's `info/exclude` instead of the project's `.gitignore`, it never checks for or installs updates (the release would replace the installed app), and it does not refresh the `atlas` CLI helper.

**IPC** is Tauri's `invoke()` for request/response, `listen()` for event streams. All payloads are JSON.

## Gotchas

- **The old SDK's patch table is gone (#54).** The two vendored-fork `[patch.crates-io]` overrides and their compile guards were deleted with the previous native path itself. The two failure classes they fixed are still guarded, by tests against the engine that replaced them rather than by a patch table: a chunk-split fixture that splits an SSE frame at every byte position, and a cancel test that asserts on the filesystem — the killed command's marker file never appears. See the root `Cargo.toml`'s `[patch.crates-io]` comment.
- **`vite.config.ts`'s `dedupe` is load-bearing.** Lazy-loaded language packages (`lang-json`, `lang-rust`, …) each transitively import `@codemirror/{state,view,language}` and `@lezer/*`; without `dedupe`, Rollup can ship two copies in the production bundle. `EditorView.theme(...)` then registers against one copy's `StyleModule` while the `EditorView` construction uses the other, and the theme silently no-ops — text renders unstyled. Same story for `pdfjs-dist`: two copies mismatch the worker against the main-thread API version and PDF rendering fails. Dev mode does not reproduce either failure (Vite serves a single pre-bundled instance) — this only shows up in production builds.
- **Release-profile `panic = "unwind"` is required.** The local-LLM loader (`atlas-embed`, used by memory chat) `catch_unwind`s candle's Metal kernel-compile panic to fall back to CPU. `panic = "abort"` would crash the app outright instead of degrading gracefully; the cost is a small amount of extra binary size for unwind tables.
- **The single-instance plugin is release-only.** Registered behind `#[cfg(not(debug_assertions))]` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. Registering it in debug builds kills `tauri dev` the instant it starts whenever the installed `/Applications/Atlas.app` is already running — the dev process gets treated as the "second instance," forwards its argv, and exits.
- **Telemetry is opt-out and on by default** (`share_telemetry: true` in `state/app_state.rs`), despite `src-tauri/src/telemetry/mod.rs`'s module doc claiming zero analytics until explicit opt-in via a first-run consent prompt that doesn't exist in the code. `app_state.rs` reflects actual behavior; the doc comment is stale. Metadata is coarse and inert without a PostHog key. The auto-updater's remote-config check runs independently of the telemetry opt-in — gated only by the separate `auto_update` setting.
