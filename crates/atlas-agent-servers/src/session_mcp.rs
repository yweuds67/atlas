//! MCP servers the host hands a session.
//!
//! ACP carries MCP servers on the session request itself (`session/new`,
//! `session/load` and `session/resume` each take `mcpServers`), so what a
//! session is offered has to be settled before the request goes out. For a
//! new session that is before its id exists: the host mints whatever the
//! entry needs (a bearer token, say) against the *request*, and learns the id
//! only when the connection [binds](SessionMcpOffer::bind) the offer to the
//! session that came back. An offer that is never bound — the request failed,
//! or the connection never sent it — is released when it drops, so nothing the
//! host minted outlives an attempt that went nowhere.
//!
//! The host decides what to offer; the connection only carries it, and never
//! sends a transport the agent did not advertise ([`admissible`]). ACP makes
//! stdio mandatory for every agent and HTTP/SSE opt-in through
//! `mcpCapabilities`, and that is the only gate: never the agent's identity.
