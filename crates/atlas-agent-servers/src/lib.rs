//! Atlas's port of Zed's `agent_servers` crate — the transport to an external
//! ACP agent, and the launcher that starts one.
//!
//! Source of truth: `~/Codes/zed-ref/crates/agent_servers/src/`. This crate is
//! where the port's reliability lives; Zed's research notes call `acp.rs` the
//! highest-value thing to port because all the correctness mechanics are in it.
//! Each one is ported with the failure it prevents recorded at the code:
//!
//! - **`initialize` raced against child exit**, with a 250 ms grace so a binary
//!   that dies on startup reports its stderr instead of hanging on "connecting".
//! - **Session pre-registration before the load RPC resolves**, so the
//!   `session/update` notifications that replay history during `session/load`
//!   find a thread instead of being dropped.
//! - **Ref-counted `close_session` with pending-load dedup**, so a second opener
//!   joins the in-flight load and the session is only really closed once the
//!   last handle goes.
//! - **[`session::CancelSignal`]**, which does two jobs a cancel needs and the
//!   wire notification cannot do alone. It turns an agent's "operation was
//!   aborted" internal error into a clean `StopReason::Cancelled` when we are
//!   the ones who cancelled — per turn, so a cancel cannot be spent on a turn
//!   it was not meant for. And it is the deadline: `cancel` is a notification
//!   with no response and no obligation, so an agent that ignores it left the
//!   prompt pending forever, and the chat could only be recovered by quitting.
//! - **`LoadError::Exited { status, stderr }` fanned out to every live session**,
//!   so an agent dying mid-turn surfaces in the conversation.
//!
//! Nothing links this crate yet. It is stage 1 of
//! `plans/atlas-acp-zed-port-plan.md`.
//!
//! # The dispatch queue IS ported — the first cut of this crate got that wrong
//!
//! Zed's `acp.rs` carries a substantial machine — `ForegroundWork`,
//! `ClientContext` behind an `mpsc`, `enqueue_request` / `enqueue_notification`,
//! a foreground dispatch task. This crate originally dismissed it as a GPUI
//! `!Send` workaround and awaited handlers inline. That reading was wrong: the
//! SDK dispatches inbound messages serially and awaits each registered closure
//! to completion before parsing the next, so an inline-awaited permission
//! prompt froze every message behind it — tool results, text, other sessions'
//! work, and the `$/cancel` that would have ended the wait. The queue is what
//! keeps a handler's WAIT out of the pipeline while keeping its state mutation
//! in wire order; only GPUI's threading was the workaround. Ported shape and
//! the full account: [`handlers`] module docs (#28).
//!
//! # Other divergences
//!
//! - **No `model_sniff`.** Model selection is config-options-first, matching Zed
//!   (research §D12-4, DECIDED). Nothing here probes an agent for a model list.
//! - **`fs/*` is served from disk**, per the same decision documented in
//!   `atlas_acp_thread`. An agent reading a modified-but-unsaved file sees the
//!   on-disk version.
//! - **Host facts are parameters, not globals.** Zed reads its release channel,
//!   app version, proxy settings and MCP server list off GPUI globals; they
//!   arrive here through [`server::ConnectOptions`] so this crate stays leaf-
//!   level and testable.
//! - **Remote/SSH command templating is not ported** — Zed rewrites the spawn
//!   through its remote client when the project lives on another host. Atlas is
//!   local-only.
