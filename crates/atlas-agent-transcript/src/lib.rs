//! Where an agent keeps its record of a conversation, and how to read Atlas's
//! own text back out of one.
//!
//! This crate used to hold the Claude Code JSONL replay — parsing
//! `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<id>.jsonl` so a resumed Claude session
//! painted its history instantly. That is gone: Atlas no longer reads another
//! program's private storage to draw its own UI (ADR-0001), it has recorded
//! every agent's transcript itself since the usage re-source, and anything
//! older replays from the agent through `session/load`.
//!
//! What is left is small and still shared widely:
//!
//! - [`TranscriptKind`] — whether an agent keeps a record Atlas can read, which
//!   is what decides whether Atlas records its own copy.
//! - [`encode_cwd`] — the cwd→folder-name slug the agent CLIs use. Still needed
//!   by the checkpoint importer and the memory corpus, whose contract
//!   (touchpoint #11) explicitly preserves their reads.
//! - [`wrap_memory_envelope`] / [`strip_injected_context`] /
//!   [`is_injected_user_text`] — keeping Atlas's own memory scaffolding from
//!   being mistaken for something the user typed, and out of the agents' own
//!   memory files.
//!
//! Nothing here names a protocol version, and nothing here should.
