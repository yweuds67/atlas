//! One-shot command terminals — the engine behind ACP's `terminal/*` methods
//! (P1.2, `plans/atlas-acp-parity-loop.md`).
//!
//! This is a different animal from [`crate::TerminalManager`], which exists to
//! back the *interactive* terminal pane: that one spawns `$SHELL -l`, streams
//! every byte to the UI over an mpsc channel, and never ends. ACP instead asks
//! the client to run one specific `command` + `args`, retain a bounded window of
//! its output, and report an exit status — a command runner. Trying to express
//! that on top of the interactive manager would mean writing a command into a
//! login shell's stdin and guessing where its output ended, so the two share
//! `portable_pty` and nothing else.
//!
//! A PTY (rather than plain pipes) is deliberate: the agent runs build tools and
//! test runners, and those switch to terse, un-coloured output when they detect
//! they are not attached to a terminal. Running them on a PTY is what makes the
//! captured output match what the user would have seen in their own shell.
