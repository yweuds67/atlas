//! The remote half of the board, held in memory.
//!
//! # Why a cache rather than a read-through
//!
//! `artifacts_board` is called on every capture event and every git change
//! while the Timeline is open. If it awaited the network, the board would stall
//! behind a request on a surface whose whole appeal is that it is instant, and
//! it would show nothing at all offline — where the local Sessions are still
//! perfectly readable.
//!
//! So the network read and the board read are separated. A refresher fills this
//! cache in the background and the socket patches it; the board read takes a
//! lock and merges. A cold cache means a board with only local rows, which is
//! exactly the right offline answer.
//!
//! # Why it is keyed by Organisation, not by Project
//!
//! Every board row carries its own `workspaceId`, and `GET /sessions?org=` fans
//! out across the Organisation in one call. Keying per Project would mean one
//! request per Project to assemble the same list, and would leave Projects this
//! machine has never bound invisible — which is most of them, for anyone who
//! has not checked out every repository the team owns.
//!
//! # Why it is not persisted
//!
//! A remote Session is someone else's record of work that did not happen here.
//! Keeping a stale copy across restarts would put rows on the board that may
//! since have been deleted, with no way to notice.
