//! The read half of the artifacts API.
//!
//! Async reqwest, one client reused across calls. Every door is org-scoped and
//! every door mints a fresh token — the access JWT lives ten minutes and
//! nothing here holds one long enough for caching to be worth the staleness.
//!
//! **This module never writes a Session.** Pushing artifacts is
//! `atlas_checkpoint::sync`'s job and stays there; duplicating the outbox here
//! would give two code paths the right to claim a row was sent.
