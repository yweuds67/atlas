//! Who is connected, to which Projects and Sessions, and what to do when one
//! drops.
//!
//! Shaped on `atlas_comms::manager`, with the two things that make an
//! org-switch safe carried over — and one lesson it had to learn twice:
//!
//! * **Identity is per connection, not per manager.** Every supervisor task
//!   carries the `epoch` of the registry slot it was started for, and may only
//!   touch a slot carrying that same epoch. A retarget that leaves a Project in
//!   the wanted set never disturbs its live socket; a retarget that drops one
//!   removes the slot, which is what stops the task. The first version used a
//!   single manager-wide generation instead, bumped on *every* retarget — so a
//!   socket opened at boot was stale by the third retarget (auth resolves, the
//!   Organisation list merges, StrictMode re-runs the effect), and exited for
//!   good on its first disconnect, leaving a slot that swallowed every later
//!   subscribe. Realtime comments "worked, then stopped" until reopened.
//! * **Eviction forgets everything** — a dropped Project's cache entry goes
//!   with its socket, so a stale row cannot outlive the connection that
//!   produced it.
//!
//! # Two kinds of socket
//!
//! The server holds **one** subscribed Session per socket, on the socket's own
//! attachment, and sends entry and comment frames only to sockets subscribed
//! to that Session. `session.summary` reaches every socket on the Project.
//!
//! So there are two kinds of slot, told apart by [`Slot::session`]:
//!
//! * A **board socket** (`session: None`) per Project this machine has bound to
//!   Cloud, from [`ArtifactsManager::retarget`]. It subscribes to nothing and
//!   exists to keep the board live.
//! * A **follower socket** (`session: Some`) per Session someone is looking
//!   at, from [`ArtifactsManager::follow`]. It subscribes to exactly that
//!   Session as its first frame, and it is dialled for *any* Project in the
//!   Organisation — a teammate's Session lives in a Project this machine never
//!   bound, and the server authorises the socket by membership, not by
//!   binding.
//!
//! The first version had one socket per Project carrying one desired Session.
//! That lost in two ways at once: a Session in an unbound Project waited for
//! a socket that was never going to open, and two surfaces on the same
//! Project (the Timeline and a chat tab) fought over the one subscription —
//! whichever unmounted last unsubscribed the other, for good.
//!
//! Followers are refcounted, so two surfaces on one Session share one socket,
//! and they are recorded before the Organisation is known: the first retarget
//! at boot runs before auth resolves and tears everything down, and a follow
//! issued in that window must still be dialled once an Organisation is named.
