//! **Atlas artifacts** — the read half of the Organisation's timeline.
//!
//! The desktop already pushes: `atlas_checkpoint::sync` drains the local
//! outbox to the ingest service, blob-first, with a bisect on rejection. That
//! path is blocking, well tested, and stays exactly where it is. This crate is
//! everything in the other direction — remote Sessions, comments, and the
//! realtime socket — which needs tokio and a WebSocket, and would have dragged
//! async into a crate that is deliberately synchronous.
//!
//! # The invariant that makes a merged board possible
//!
//! `rowId` on the wire is the **local** row id. The desktop mints it, pushes it
//! verbatim, and the server uses it as its primary key. So a Session, a
//! message, a tool call and a Checkpoint keep one identity on both sides, and
//! merging the remote board with the local one is a keyed union rather than a
//! reconciliation. It is also why a comment anchor resolves against a local row
//! with no mapping table in between.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Tauri-free, like `atlas-comms`, with [`TokenSource`] as the only host seam.
//! The host supplies a closure that mints an access JWT and forwards the
//! manager's broadcast onto a window event; nothing here knows what a window
//! is.
//!
//! # Scope of a socket
//!
//! One per connected Project. The server has no org-wide socket — the web board
//! polls — but `session.summary` reaches every socket on a Project, so holding
//! one per bound Project gives the board realtime as a side effect.
