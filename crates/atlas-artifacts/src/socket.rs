//! One Project's realtime connection, from dial to close.
//!
//! Ported from `atlas_comms::conn` rather than reinvented — the artifacts
//! socket authenticates identically and has the same three failure modes, and
//! two hand-written handshakes would drift.
//!
//! ## The ticket
//!
//! Browsers cannot set headers on a WebSocket, so the access JWT rides in the
//! subprotocol list:
//!
//! ```text
//! Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: atlas.v1, atlas.ticket.<jwt>
//! ```
//!
//! The server echoes only `atlas.v1` on the 101; the ticket is never reflected.
//!
//! **Never log the request, its headers, or the URL of a failed dial.** The
//! second value in that header is a live credential, and a tungstenite HTTP
//! error can carry the whole request back — which is why every log line below
//! prints a classification rather than an error's own `Display`.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Sockets are per **Project**, never per Organisation: the server has no
//! org-wide socket. `session.summary` reaches every socket on the Project, so
//! the board gets realtime for free; entry and comment frames only reach the
//! socket that subscribed to that Session — one Session per socket, which is
//! why the manager opens a follower socket per watched Session.
