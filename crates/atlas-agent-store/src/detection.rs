//! "Detected on your system" — and nothing else.
//!
//! # The invariant
//!
//! **A hit here is never a spawn rung, never a default, and never installs
//! anything.** It is data for one marketplace section, where the user can click
//! Install and get an ordinary `Custom` entry in the installed map. That entry
//! is what makes the agent exist; this module only shortens the typing.
//!
//! Zed has no PATH lookup at all (research §A3: "Resolution ladder (exact — no
//! PATH lookup exists)"). Atlas keeps this much of its old discovery because
//! the affordance is genuinely useful — a user who already has an agent CLI
//! should not have to find its path — but the thing that made the old version
//! wrong was never the probing. It was that a PATH hit *outranked* the user's
//! installed entry at spawn time (`atlas-registry/store.rs:709-725`, deleted
//! with this port). Keeping the data and deleting the ladder is the whole
//! change.
//!
//! Structurally, the invariant holds because nothing here implements
//! `ExternalAgentServer` and nothing here writes settings: a [`DetectedAgent`]
//! can only reach the store by way of a settings entry the user asked for.
