//! Prompt content — what one turn actually carries.
//!
//! Every layer from the Tauri command down to `session/prompt` carries
//! `Vec<ContentBlock>` rather than a bare `String`. Before this seam existed,
//! images had to bypass it through a staging side-channel drained by the *next*
//! send, so a staged set that never got drained silently rode a later turn.
//! Carrying content with the turn removes that class of bug entirely.
//!
//! Moved from `atlas-acp/src/prompt.rs` at Stage 3 of the Zed port and rebuilt
//! against schema 1.5. It lives beside the thread because `ContentBlock` is the
//! thread's own vocabulary, and both the external stdio connection and the
//! native agent need these conversions:
//!
//! - [`compose`] / [`from_text`] / [`with_resource_links`] — build the blocks on
//!   the way down.
//! - [`strip_unsupported`] — the capability backstop.
//! - [`flatten_text`] — collapse them back to a string for the native agent,
//!   which has no multimodal input path.
