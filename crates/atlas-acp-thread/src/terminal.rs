//! Agent-created terminals — ported from
//! `zed-ref/crates/acp_thread/src/terminal.rs` and the provider-event handling
//! at `acp_thread.rs:4639-4715`.
//!
//! The mechanism worth porting is the **out-of-order buffering**. A terminal's
//! `Created` event is not guaranteed to reach the thread before its first
//! `Output` or even its `Exit`: the agent gets the terminal id back from
//! `terminal/create` and can reference it in a `session/update` immediately,
//! which races the client's own bookkeeping. Zed handles this with two
//! side-tables keyed by terminal id (`pending_terminal_output`,
//! `pending_terminal_exit`) that are drained when `Created` finally lands.
//! Without them the first chunk of a fast command's output is silently lost —
//! which is exactly what the agent then reads back as the command's result.
//!
//! Divergence from Zed: Zed's `Terminal` wraps a full `terminal::Terminal`
//! entity (an alacritty grid it renders). Atlas runs agent commands through
//! [`atlas_terminal::command::CommandTerminal`], which already owns the PTY and
//! keeps a bounded output buffer, so the port keeps Zed's *event and buffering*
//! shape and delegates the running to that. Zed's OS-sandbox wrapper
//! (`SandboxWrap`) is not ported: it depends on Zed's `sandbox` crate and is a
//! separate feature from the thread model.
