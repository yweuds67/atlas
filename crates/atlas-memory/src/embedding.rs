//! The embedding-provider seam.
//!
//! Ported into Atlas from the old SDK's embeddings crate. Only the trait and its error type
//! were carried over — the SDK's hosted OpenAI/Gemini providers and its
//! in-memory `EmbeddingStore`/`VectorIndex` are not used here (they have no
//! save/load/remove; `crate::store` drives `usearch` directly).
//!
//! [`MiniLmProvider`](crate::MiniLmProvider) is the only implementor today. The
//! trait stays async and batch-shaped so a remote BYOK provider can drop in
//! behind it without touching call sites.
