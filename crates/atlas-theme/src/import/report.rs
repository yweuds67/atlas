//! What an import actually did, in a shape the UI can render without knowing
//! anything about the source format.
//!
//! The report is the product here, not a diagnostic. A VS Code theme converted
//! to Atlas is a *starting point* — well over half of [`crate::theme_keys`] has
//! no workbench or TextMate equivalent at all — and a user who cannot see that
//! will read the result as a faithful port and file the difference as a bug.
//! So every importer records three things for every value it produces:
//!
//! | | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | **mapped** | the source said this, verbatim |
//! | **derived** | the source did not say it; Atlas worked it out (and from what) |
//! | **ignored** | the source said it and Atlas has nowhere to put it |
//!
//! `ignored` is the one that earns its keep: a bare count reads as failure,
//! while "42 ignored — 31 workbench chrome, 8 markup scopes, 3 shadow recipe"
//! reads as the honest summary it is. Hence [`ImportCounts::ignored_by_category`].
