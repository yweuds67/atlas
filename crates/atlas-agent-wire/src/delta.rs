//! Wire shape for session-scoped delta events (additive-only; see [`crate::types`]).
//!
//! One change to one session, routed through a [`DeltaSink`] the host provides
//! (typically a window-event emitter) and fanned out on an [`EventBus`] for
//! in-process subscribers.
//!
//! They are produced by projecting thread events (`atlas-agent-delta`). See
//! [`crate::types`] for why they live in a crate of their own.
