//! The session-delta wire types — additive-only.
//!
//! These shapes are what `CaptureMiddleware`, the analytics/transcript/memory
//! middleware and the whole chat UI pattern-match on, by concrete variant and
//! field. That is why they are not edited casually:
//!
//! - Adding an optional field or a new variant is ordinary work. Do it in the
//!   same change as its consumers, plus `tests/contract.rs` and
//!   `tests/wire-shape-contract.test.ts`.
//! - Renaming or removing a variant or field, or changing what a field means,
//!   is a breaking change: every consumer (chat store / UI, capture recorder,
//!   analytics/transcript/memory) is updated in the same change.
//!
//! The contract tests are the authority; the TS mirror is `src/types/agents.ts`.
//!
//! They live in their own crate because the protocol crates pin their schema
//! crate exactly, so a wire type defined in one stack was unreachable from
//! another (the old 1.3 stack and the 2.0 port coexisted for a day). It stays
//! separate so the wire names no protocol version; `atlas-agent-delta` is where
//! thread events are projected onto it.
