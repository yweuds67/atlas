//! Reading agent transcripts that already exist on disk.
//!
//! This closes the two highest product risks in one mechanism.
//!
//! **Cold start.** A timeline's value is proportional to its history, and
//! without this the board ships empty and stays that way for months. Meanwhile a
//! developer's own transcripts are already sitting in `~/.claude/projects/` —
//! hundreds of Sessions, hundreds of megabytes. Importing them makes day one
//! look like month six.
//!
//! **The terminal gap.** Someone who runs `claude` in a terminal instead of
//! inside Atlas produces a Session that does not exist in Atlas, which reads as
//! a bug and permanently undermines trust in the record. The same reader that
//! backfills history keeps picking up new terminal Sessions as they appear.
//!
//! # Three rules that are not obvious
//!
//! **Imported Sessions get no Checkpoints.** The link rule needs
//! `existed_before` captured at write time, which is unknowable retroactively —
//! inferring it would manufacture exactly the false attribution the rule exists
//! to prevent. This is a deliberate divergence from Entire's importer, which
//! *does* reconstruct checkpoint records from old transcripts. It can, because
//! its checkpoints are self-contained snapshots making no attribution claim;
//! Atlas's assert "this Session produced this commit", and imported data cannot
//! honestly support that. Do not "fix" this later by copying Entire.
//!
//! **Cross-source dedupe is explicit work here, not a schema guarantee.** The
//! UNIQUE constraint covers `(project, source, native_id)` and therefore
//! dedupes *re-imports*. It does **not** dedupe across sources — Atlas's
//! ACP-hosted Claude Code writes JSONL to the very same directory, so
//! `('acp', id)` and `('external_jsonl', id)` are both permitted rows. Skipping
//! that duplicate is this module's job.
//!
//! **Redaction applies identically.** Imported content goes through the same
//! on-write scrubbing as live capture, titles included. An old transcript is
//! exactly as likely to contain a pasted key as a new one.
//!
//! # Failure containment
//!
//! One bad line costs that line; one bad file costs that file; only the store
//! itself failing stops the pass. The distinction matters because the importer
//! re-runs every thirty seconds forever: an error that propagated freely would
//! re-abort the same corpus on every tick, and a transcript sorting *after* the
//! poisoned one would never import at all.
