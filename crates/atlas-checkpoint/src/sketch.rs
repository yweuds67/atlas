//! A compact fingerprint of file content, and the containment test the link
//! rule uses to decide whether a commit still carries an agent's work.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The link rule's strict arm — for a file the agent *created* — used to demand
//! that the committed blob equal the agent's bytes exactly. That rejects the
//! most ordinary loop there is: the agent scaffolds a file, the developer reads
//! it and adjusts a line, then commits. One added comment and the Checkpoint
//! silently disappeared.
//!
//! Loosening it to path-alone is not an option either: the strict arm is what
//! stops "the agent created it, the human threw it away and wrote their own"
//! from being credited to the agent. So the question is not *whether* the
//! content matches but *how much* of it survived.
//!
//! # What is stored, and why not the content
//!
//! Answering that needs the agent's content at link time, which can be minutes
//! or days after the write. Keeping whole files would duplicate the worktree
//! inside `sessions.db` for every touch, so instead each write stores a
//! bounded **sketch**: the hashes of its distinct non-blank lines, lowest-value
//! first, capped at [`MAX_LINES`].
//!
//! That is a bottom-k sample, so truncation is *stable*: two versions of a file
//! that share most lines also share most of the sample, because both sides keep
//! the same low-hashed lines rather than an arbitrary prefix. A plain "first
//! N lines" cap would have made an edit near the top look like a total rewrite.
//!
//! # Containment, not similarity
//!
//! The test is asymmetric on purpose. We ask *"how much of what the agent wrote
//! is still in the commit?"* — not *"how alike are these two files?"*. A
//! developer who appends 500 lines of their own to the agent's 20 has still
//! committed the agent's work; a symmetric measure (Jaccard) would score that
//! pair as barely related and drop the link.
