//! One visible signal per Project, replacing nine invisible failures.
//!
//! Every failure path in this feature shares a design instinct — never block the
//! developer's work — which is correct. But "never block" plus "never tell"
//! equals a record with holes that nobody discovers until they need the history
//! and it is not there. The failures are real and each is silent on its own:
//!
//! * the commit cursor was garbage collected and detection recovered by re-scan;
//! * the disk filled and turns stopped being recorded;
//! * a second Atlas window holds the writer lock, so this one is not capturing;
//! * a redaction failure flagged a Session nobody is looking at;
//! * rows are stuck in a failed sync state;
//! * the git watcher died, so commits stop being linked;
//! * the capture worker thread died, so nothing is being recorded at all;
//! * the server revoked this identity, so the drain stopped;
//! * a history rewrite orphaned Checkpoints in bulk.
//!
//! The fix is not error handling scattered across all of them. It is **one
//! state, per Project, with a reason** — computed here from what the store
//! already records, so the individual paths keep failing quietly and this is the
//! single place that says so.
//!
//! This module deliberately fixes none of the underlying failures; each has its
//! own criteria in its own ticket. It makes them visible.
