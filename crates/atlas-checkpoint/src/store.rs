//! The local store: `.atlas/sessions.db` plus its blob sidecar.
//!
//! `.atlas/` is the established per-project state directory — auto-gitignored,
//! already used by a dozen features — but this is the first SQLite database
//! Atlas has ever created, so WAL setup, versioning and corruption handling are
//! established here.
//!
//! Two properties are worth stating because everything else follows from them:
//!
//! * **The store is on the critical path; the network is not.** Nothing in this
//!   module can block on a network call, because Local mode and offline capture
//!   are the same code path as everything else.
//! * **One turn is one transaction.** A crash mid-write rolls back to the last
//!   completed turn rather than leaving a torn record that reads as finished.
