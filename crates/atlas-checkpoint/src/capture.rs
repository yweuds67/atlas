//! The write path: agent events in, redacted rows out.
//!
//! This is the only module allowed to put agent content into the store, and the
//! reason it is the only one is that redaction happens *here* — before
//! persistence, not before upload. There is one code path that can be forgotten
//! rather than two, and the local store is consequently never itself a
//! disclosure risk, so every later feature (sync, export, share, support
//! bundles) inherits the guarantee for free.
//!
//! Two rules govern everything below:
//!
//! * **Never block the turn.** Capture observes; it does not participate. Every
//!   entry point returns a `Result` the caller logs and moves past, and none of
//!   them can panic the agent runtime.
//! * **Fail closed, but loudly.** If content cannot be scrubbed it is not
//!   written — and the Session is flagged so a human finds out. Silently
//!   dropping a turn produces a record with holes that nobody discovers until
//!   they need the history and it is not there.
