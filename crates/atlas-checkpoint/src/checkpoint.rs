//! Turning observed commits into Checkpoints.
//!
//! A developer works with an agent and then commits — from the Atlas git panel,
//! from the integrated terminal, from lazygit, from a different editor, or on a
//! laptop where Atlas was closed at the time. In every one of those cases a
//! Checkpoint should appear linking the Session to that commit.
//!
//! Commits are **observed, not intercepted**. The repository is never modified:
//! no hooks installed, no refs written, no config touched. Hooks were rejected
//! because they mutate the user's repository, must chain whatever else is
//! already installed, need per-repo consent, and — decisively — cannot see a
//! commit made before they existed. Watching refs move can, which is what lets
//! the open-time walk pick up everything that happened while Atlas was closed.
//!
//! # The link rule, and why it is asymmetric
//!
//! For each path present in both the commit and a Session's touched files:
//!
//! * The file **existed** in the parent commit → link on the path alone.
//!   Reviewing and tweaking agent output before committing is the normal
//!   workflow, and demanding an exact content match here would silently discard
//!   most real Sessions.
//! * The file is **new** → link only if the committed blob matches what the
//!   agent actually wrote. This is what stops "the agent created it, the human
//!   deleted it and wrote their own" from being credited to the agent.
//!
//! Getting either half wrong is invisible. Too strict and the feature quietly
//! records almost nothing; too loose and it confidently attributes human work to
//! an agent. The asymmetry is the whole design.
//!
//! Two bounds keep the rule honest over time:
//!
//! * **Touches are consumed.** Once a commit has settled a touched path —
//!   linked it, or displaced it (the human replaced the agent's new file) —
//!   that touch stops nominating the Session for later commits. Without this,
//!   every future commit to a hot file, including purely human work months
//!   later and teammate commits arriving via pull, would be attributed to the
//!   Session forever. This is the carry-forward rule from Entire's link engine,
//!   and it is the load-bearing half of the design.
//! * **Time.** A commit is never linked to a Session that started after the
//!   commit was created, which is what makes the bounded recovery re-scan safe:
//!   historical commits that predate every Session can neither link nor consume.
//!
//! # Merges
//!
//! The walk follows the first parent and a merge commit itself creates no
//! Checkpoints — linking a merge would credit every merged-in change a second
//! time, under a commit that did not produce it, and `git pull` creates merge
//! commits constantly. The side branch's *own* commits are not lost, though:
//! when the walk encounters a merge it evaluates the commits the merge brought
//! in (`first-parent..second-parent`, merges excluded) through the same link
//! rule, so work committed on a side branch while Atlas was closed and then
//! merged is linked exactly once, at the commit that actually produced it.
