//! One writer per Project.
//!
//! Atlas is a multi-window app and two windows can hold the same Project open.
//! Two capture loops writing one SQLite file with no coordination corrupts the
//! outbox state machine — both would claim the same pending rows, and a row can
//! be marked `sent` by one process while the other is still trying to send it.
//! WAL mode makes that concurrency *possible*, which is exactly the problem;
//! it serialises writes, it does not make two independent writers agree.
//!
//! The lock is an exclusive SQLite transaction held open on a tiny sidecar
//! database for the lifetime of the store. That gets a real, OS-level,
//! automatically-released lock without adding a file-locking dependency, and
//! without the cross-platform footguns of advisory locks on the main database
//! (which WAL would happily let both processes take).
//!
//! Release is by drop, including on a crash — the OS closes the handle, SQLite
//! rolls the transaction back, and the next window to open takes over. There is
//! deliberately no stale-lock timeout, because a timeout is exactly how you get
//! two writers.
