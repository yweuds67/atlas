//! Schema and migrations.
//!
//! Atlas has never created a SQLite database before — the one existing rusqlite
//! call site reads Codex's own store read-only — so the versioning policy is
//! established here. It is deliberately the simplest thing that can survive a
//! downgrade: an integer in `user_version`, forward-only migrations, and a hard
//! refusal to touch a database written by a newer build. Silently operating on a
//! schema you do not understand is how you corrupt the record you exist to keep.
//!
//! Indexes are part of the schema rather than an afterthought. The two queries
//! that must never full-scan are the outbox drain and the ordered read behind
//! the session-detail sidebar, and both are covered below.
