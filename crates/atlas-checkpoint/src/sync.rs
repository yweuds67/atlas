//! Getting the record off the machine and into the Organisation.
//!
//! This is the only module here that touches the network, and everything about
//! its shape follows from one rule: **capture never waits for it**. Offline is
//! the ordinary case, not the error case. Rows accumulate as `pending`, the
//! drain moves them when it can, and nothing upstream ever blocks or reports a
//! failure because a connection was unavailable.
//!
//! # Ordering is blob-first, and that is a rule
//!
//! A row referencing a spilled payload is sent only after that payload is
//! confirmed in blob storage, and is marked `sent` only after the server
//! acknowledges the row. The failure this forbids: a row lands, its blob upload
//! failed, and a *teammate* opens the message to find nothing — a dangling
//! reference in a shared timeline, discovered by the reader rather than the
//! sender. The inverse leak (blob uploaded, row never sent) is tolerable: an
//! unreferenced object costs pennies, not trust, and is logged for a future GC.
//!
//! # Failure is a state machine, not an error
//!
//! * **Offline / 5xx** — rows stay pending, backoff, nothing surfaces.
//! * **429** — honoured with backoff. A rate limit is not a poison row. The
//!   server's `Retry-After` hint, when present, travels out in the outcome so
//!   the host's scheduler can honour it instead of guessing.
//! * **401** — the access token expired. Refresh **once per drain** and
//!   continue *mid-drain*: tokens are short-lived and a post-promotion first
//!   drain runs far longer than one token lifetime. Exactly once, because a
//!   freshly-minted JWT always differs from the previous one — refreshing on
//!   every 401 against a server that keeps saying 401 (clock skew, key
//!   rotation, audience mismatch) is a hot loop, not a retry.
//! * **403** — terminal, on the push path *and* the blob path. Removed from
//!   the Organisation, or the Project was deleted. Retrying forever would be
//!   a permanent spinner; this stops and says "no longer authorized". Local
//!   capture continues untouched.
//! * **A single bad row** — marked failed and skipped, so one malformed record
//!   never stalls everything behind it. Per-artifact results handle this when
//!   the server sends them; when it rejects a whole batch without naming a
//!   row, the drain **bisects**: the batch is halved and retried until a
//!   single-row batch is refused, and that row is the convicted poison. As a
//!   cross-invocation backstop, rows whose attempts exhaust [`MAX_ATTEMPTS`]
//!   are retired to `failed` at the start of every drain.
//! * **A blob missing locally, or permanently too large (413)** — a
//!   permanently unsendable row. Marked failed immediately (the bytes are
//!   gone, or will never fit), never deferred forever under a pending count.
