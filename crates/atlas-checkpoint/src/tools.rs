//! Turning what the wire says into something you can `GROUP BY`.
//!
//! The session-detail sidebar shows live counts — *Tool calls 4 · File edits 1 ·
//! Bash 1 · Read 2* — and those have to resolve to a query. The obstacle is that
//! **the wire has no canonical tool name**. ACP carries `toolCallId`, `title`,
//! `kind`, `status`, `content`, `locations` and `rawInput`; there is no field
//! holding "Bash". What the runtime exposes as `tool_name` is the first-sighting
//! *title*, and the two agent families put very different things there:
//!
//! * the **native agent** emits the real tool name as the title (`"Read"`,
//!   `"Bash"`), so its first sighting is already canonical;
//! * **ACP agents** emit a human display string (`"Edit src/foo.rs"`,
//!   `"Bash(cargo test)"`, `"Read /Users/…/lib.rs"`).
//!
//! So the canonical name is *derived*, deliberately and testably, and stored in
//! its own column beside the display title. Grouping by the raw wire value would
//! produce one bucket per file the agent touched, which is not a count of
//! anything.
