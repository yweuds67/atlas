//! The read model: turning the capture tables back into something a developer
//! can look at.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate writes. Nothing read it back. A recorder with
//! no viewer is indistinguishable from a recorder that does not work, which is
//! the whole reason this module exists — the store already held every fact these
//! shapes carry, and none of it had a way out.
//!
//! Two shapes, matching the two things a developer wants:
//!
//! * [`SessionSummary`] — one row per Session, cheap enough to list hundreds.
//!   Counts come from indexed aggregates; no message body or blob is touched.
//! * [`SessionDetail`] — one Session in full, as a single ordered timeline of
//!   prompts, responses, tool calls and Checkpoints.
//!
//! Both are deliberately **flat and serialisable**: they cross the Tauri
//! boundary as JSON, so they hold resolved strings rather than ids the frontend
//! would have to join.
//!
//! ## Why bodies are inlined conditionally
//!
//! A message body can be a 40 MB pasted log. Sending every body for every
//! message would make opening a Session slower than the work it recorded. So a
//! body is inlined when it is small, and otherwise the 2 KB preview is sent with
//! [`TimelineEntry::truncated`] set — the viewer shows what it has and says the
//! rest is on disk. This is the same trade the store makes when it spills.
