//! One path through the manager with a real child process on the end of it.
//!
//! Every other test in this crate stops at a fake `AgentServer`, so nothing
//! exercised the thing the manager exists to own: resolving a command, spawning
//! it, completing the `initialize` handshake, and — the half that matters for
//! ATL-227 and ATL-228 — making sure the process is gone afterwards. A fake
//! connection cannot fail to die.
//!
//! The agent is a small python script, the same fixture shape
//! `atlas-agent-servers/tests/connect.rs` uses, because what is under test is
//! the spawn-and-teardown path rather than any particular agent.
