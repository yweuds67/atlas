//! What crosses the bridge to the renderer.
//!
//! Mirrored by hand in TypeScript, as `AuthSnapshot` already is. Everything
//! here is a *projection* of [`crate::state::ChatState`] — the renderer applies
//! these mechanically and decides nothing.
//!
//! **Casing:** event *names* are camelCase (`messageAppended`), because they are
//! read as a discriminant in a TS switch. Every *field* stays snake_case,
//! because most of them are wire objects — a `Conversation` carries
//! `member_ids` and a message carries `conv_id`, and translating half of a
//! payload would leave the renderer holding two dialects of the same object.
//!
//! The governing rule: **steady state emits granular events; bulk transitions
//! emit one [`CommsEvent::Resync`]**. A resume replay of five thousand frames
//! is one repaint, not five thousand events, and the renderer re-reads the
//! snapshot commands when the epoch moves.
