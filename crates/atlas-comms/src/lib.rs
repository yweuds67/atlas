//! Team chat against the `atlas-chat` API.
//!
//! One WebSocket per active Organisation, owned here rather than by the
//! renderer, for two independent reasons that are both hard:
//!
//! 1. **The WS ticket *is* the access JWT.** The renderer runs with no CSP and
//!    renders agent-authored markdown; a token in that heap is one injection
//!    away from exfiltration. So the renderer never holds one, which means it
//!    can neither open the socket nor make a REST call.
//! 2. **The socket is the notification transport.** The server's email digest
//!    deliberately skips anyone holding a live socket — "the app has told
//!    them". A socket that opened when a panel did would mean: panel closed,
//!    no notification, an email instead.
//!
//! The renderer is therefore a projection: it applies [`events::CommsEvent`]s
//! and invokes commands, and it decides nothing.
//!
//! Layering, innermost first:
//!
//! * [`wire`] — the frames, and the journaled/ephemeral split.
//! * [`state`] — the authoritative state and a pure reducer over it.
//! * [`store`] — the `seq` watermark and the paint-before-connect snapshot.
//! * [`events`] — what crosses the bridge.
//!
//! Nothing here depends on Tauri. The host supplies a [`TokenSource`]; that is
//! the whole seam.
