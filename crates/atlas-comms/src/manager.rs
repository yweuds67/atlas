//! The app-global orchestrator: one socket per active Organisation, the
//! authoritative state, and the policies that decide when to try again.
//!
//! ## The emission rule
//!
//! Steady state emits **granular** events. Bulk transitions — `hello`, a resume
//! replay, a cold sync — apply their frames **silently**, bump the epoch, and
//! emit one [`CommsEvent::Resync`]. A five-thousand-frame replay is one repaint
//! rather than five thousand events, and the renderer re-reads the snapshot
//! commands when the epoch moves.
