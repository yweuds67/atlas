//! The D10 token provider: an Atlas access JWT, minted per request.
//!
//! The engine's `ExternalAuth` trait is the injection point. What it buys, from
//! machinery the engine already ships, is exactly the three things the gateway's
//! auth contract demands (`docs/reference/atlas-ai-api.md` §12.2):
//!
//! - **per-request auth resolution** — `resolve()` runs on every request, so a
//!   token is never baked in at construction time;
//! - **proactive re-mint** — this type re-mints at `exp − 60s` rather than
//!   waiting for a failure;
//! - **401 refresh-once-then-retry** — `refresh()` is what the engine calls on
//!   an `Unauthorized`, and it forces a fresh mint.
//!
//! **Why not the static-bearer path.** The engine can take a fixed API key, and
//! for a provider key that is correct — those do not expire on a ten-minute
//! clock. For the gateway token it would be a bug: a static bearer has no
//! refresh and no 401 recovery, so every session would die at the TTL. The
//! distinction is D10's, and it is the reason this file exists.
//!
//! **What this does not have to defend against.** §3.1 of the gateway doc:
//! *"Auth is an admission decision. It is verified once at request start and
//! never re-checked mid-stream."* A token expiring mid-turn does not truncate
//! the in-flight request — the *next* request is the one that fails. So the
//! shape being defended against is a stalled second turn, not a broken first
//! one, and a re-mint that costs a round trip is affordable.
