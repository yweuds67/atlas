//! Projecting a gateway catalogue row into the engine's own record.
//!
//! **No model is named in this file.** The list of models Atlas Agent may use
//! is the gateway's (`GET /v1/catalogue`), fetched and cached by
//! [`crate::engine::catalog_cache`] (ADR-0007). What lives here is the one
//! thing the gateway cannot know: what the engine needs to be told about a
//! model so that a turn over the Chat Completions dialect survives the
//! crossing.
//!
//! The engine can fetch a catalogue from `{base}/models`, and against this
//! gateway that path does not work: the engine's fetch adds a
//! `?client_version=` parameter the contract does not define, and then
//! deserializes the reply as its own rich `{"models":[…]}` record — where the
//! gateway serves the stock OpenAI `{"object":"list","data":[…]}` list, which
//! shares nothing with it but the path segment. So the seam builds the record
//! itself and hands it to the engine through `model_catalog_json`, the
//! engine's first-class static path.
//!
//! # Where these rows differ from an upstream row, and why
//!
//! Every difference is the gateway's allowlist showing through. Reasoning
//! effort, reasoning summaries, verbosity and service tiers all ride request
//! fields the gateway answers with a `400`, so a row advertising them would
//! offer the user a control that silently does nothing. Search is off because a
//! `tool_search` tool has no Chat Completions shape. `apply_patch` stays on:
//! the dialect flattens freeform tools on the way out and turns the reply back
//! on the way in, so patching survives the crossing.
//!
//! # The context window
//!
//! `context_window` is the gateway's prompt ceiling for that model, and local
//! auto-compaction fires at 90% of whatever it says. The gateway states it
//! per row (server commit `e37ea88`, answering `docs/requests/gateway-
//! catalogue-metadata.md`), already clamped to its own gate limit, so the
//! number written here is one the engine may compact against. For a row the
//! gateway has not annotated the field is absent, the engine has no ceiling,
//! and the gateway's `413` is what ends a long thread. Two caveats travel
//! with the number and neither is fixable here: the engine counts real
//! usage-reported tokens while the gateway's `413` gate estimates
//! `ceil(bytes/3)`, so the two meters can cross; and remote compaction is
//! capability-gated to OpenAI and Azure, so only local summarisation defends
//! the ceiling.
//!
//! # The gateway is not Vertex-only
//!
//! `glm-5.3-flash` is served by Cloudflare Workers AI, not by Vertex, and it
//! bills in Workers AI *neurons* rather than tokens. Nothing in this file has
//! to care — the broker still answers OpenAI on the same
//! `/v1/chat/completions` — but do not derive anything here from the
//! publisher. It replies with a `reasoning_content` field alongside
//! `content`, which the chat stream parser reads as a reasoning item, and
//! writes `"tool_calls":null` on those chunks, which the parser reads as an
//! empty array rather than a lost frame.
