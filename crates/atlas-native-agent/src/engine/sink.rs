//! Engine notifications → thread updates.
//!
//! This is the translation layer ADR-0004 calls the seam's real work and its
//! main maintenance cost. The engine speaks its own event vocabulary; the app
//! speaks ACP session updates and `AcpThread`. Nothing else in Atlas knows both.
//!
//! **Scope.** Mapped: streamed assistant text, reasoning, turn completion,
//! retry notices, compaction, plans, and tool calls — command executions
//! (with live output), file changes (with locations, which is what feeds
//! capture's write set and therefore Artifacts checkpoints), and MCP calls.
//! What remains unmapped (sub-agent activity, image views, review-mode
//! markers, web search items) is matched explicitly below and dropped with a
//! trace rather than falling into a silent `_ => {}`, so an unmapped event is
//! visible in a log instead of being invisible in the UI.
