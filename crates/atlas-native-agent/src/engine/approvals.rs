//! Tool approvals: the engine's requests through Atlas's existing dialog.
//!
//! The vocabulary the ticket names — accept, accept-for-session, decline,
//! cancel — is not something Atlas has to invent here. The engine already
//! speaks exactly it (`FileChangeApprovalDecision`,
//! `CommandExecutionApprovalDecision`), and Atlas's dialog already speaks its
//! own three-option form plus a cancel that comes from the dialog being
//! dismissed rather than from a button. This module is the join.
//!
//! # The asymmetry worth knowing
//!
//! Atlas's dialog offers **three** options and produces a **fourth** outcome.
//! `PermissionOptionKind` has `AllowOnce`, `AllowAlways` and `RejectOnce`;
//! "cancel" is `RequestPermissionOutcome::Cancelled`, which arrives when the
//! turn is interrupted or the dialog is dismissed — never as a selection. So
//! the option list has three entries and the decision mapping has four arms,
//! and that is correct rather than an oversight.
//!
//! # Decline and cancel are not the same answer
//!
//! The engine draws a line Atlas must not blur: *"User denied … The agent will
//! continue the turn"* versus *"User denied … The turn will also be
//! immediately interrupted"*. Collapsing them would either strand a user who
//! dismissed the dialog inside a turn that keeps running, or kill a turn the
//! user only meant to steer away from one action.
