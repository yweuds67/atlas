//! The slash commands Atlas Agent advertises, and what they do.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! The composer's picker renders whatever the connected agent published, and
//! the seam published nothing — so the native agent's list was empty while
//! every external agent had one. That is the whole bug: the app has had the
//! mechanism all along (`SessionUpdate::AvailableCommandsUpdate`), and nobody
//! sent it anything.
//!
//! # What made the cut
//!
//! The request was "the engine's defaults, minus login". Each command lands by what
//! actually executes it:
//!
//! - **Protocol calls** — `/compact` (`thread/compact/start`), `/undo`
//!   (`thread/rollback`), `/goal` (`thread/goal/*`), `/review`
//!   (`review/start`, inline on this thread and on this thread's own model —
//!   `review_model` is deliberately left unset in our engine config, and the
//!   engine falls back to the parent thread's model, which the gateway
//!   serves).
//! - **A canned prompt** — `/init`: a normal turn whose text the user did not
//!   have to write.
//! - **Frontend replies** — `/diff` and `/status` answer from this side
//!   without a model turn, exactly as the upstream TUI answered them.
//! - **Skills** — whatever `skills/list` discovered for this session's cwd
//!   (user and repo scope only: the engine's bundled system skills lean on
//!   upstream services the gateway does not serve). Each runs as a turn whose
//!   input is `UserInput::Skill`.
//! - **Commands whose better surface Atlas already has** stay out of this
//!   module: `/login`/`/logout` (signing into Atlas IS signing into the agent,
//!   D10), `/model` and `/approvals` (the composer's pickers), `/new` (tabs),
//!   `/mention` (`@`). The composer synthesizes `/fork` and `/queue` itself —
//!   they drive Atlas affordances (a new tab; the send queue), not the engine.
//!
//! Everything advertised is executed; nothing is advertised that would arrive
//! as prose the engine ignores.
