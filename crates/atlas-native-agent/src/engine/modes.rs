//! Atlas's four permission modes, expressed to the engine.
//!
//! The modes are Atlas's, not the engine's, and the vocabulary is fixed by what
//! the mode picker already shows — this is a translation, not a redesign
//! (design-language invariant). The four ids also have to keep matching the
//! previous native path's, because the picker is shared and a mode set on one engine has
//! to mean the same thing on the other.
//!
//! The engine expresses permission as two orthogonal things, and both are
//! needed to say what a mode means:
//!
//! - **`SandboxPolicy`** — what the process is physically allowed to touch.
//! - **`AskForApproval`** — when the engine stops and asks before escalating.
//!
//! Using only one of them is the trap. Sandbox alone cannot express "ask
//! first", and approval alone cannot stop a command that never asks.
