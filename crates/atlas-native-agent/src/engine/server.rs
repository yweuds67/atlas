//! The launcher for the native agent, on the ported engine.
//!
//! The only implementation of `AgentServer` for the native agent. It was one of
//! two while the port was being proved; the previous native one is gone (#54), and what
//! made the swap invisible was that both answered to the same agent id.
//!
//! Like the previous native one, `connect` starts no process — the engine runs in this
//! one (ADR-0004) — and ignores the delegate, because there is no command to
//! resolve and no binary to download.
