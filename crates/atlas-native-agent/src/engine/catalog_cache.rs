//! The gateway's model catalogue, fetched and cached (ADR-0007).
//!
//! Nothing about which models Atlas Agent may use is written down in this
//! repo. The list is the gateway's — `GET /v1/catalogue` — and the only thing
//! kept locally is a copy of the gateway's last answer, in the engine's home,
//! so that a launch with no network still has a picker and a working agent.
//!
//! # The three sources, in order
//!
//! 1. **A fresh cache** (under [`CACHE_TTL`] old, fetched for the same org) is
//!    used as-is. No request goes out.
//! 2. **The gateway**, with a short timeout. A good answer overwrites the cache.
//! 3. **A stale cache** — any age, same org — when the fetch fails. The agent
//!    runs on the list it last saw; the picker is marked stale.
//!
//! With no cache and no gateway there is no list, and [`resolve`] says so with
//! [`CatalogueUnavailable`]. That is a deliberate refusal rather than a
//! fallback to a list authored here: an authored list drifts from what the
//! gateway serves, and the previous one had — it named a default the gateway
//! had since re-priced and excluded models by hand.
//!
//! # What is cached
//!
//! The gateway's rows, not the engine's records. The engine's `ModelInfo` has
//! forty-odd fields and every one of them is a projection decision made in
//! this crate (what the wire can carry, which prompt to use). Caching the
//! projection would freeze those decisions into every user's cache file; the
//! rows are what the gateway said, and [`project`] can change under them.
//!
//! # Org
//!
//! `entitled` is answered for the organisation named in the `Atlas-Org`
//! header, so a cache carries the org it was fetched for and is a miss for any
//! other. A user switching orgs must not be offered the previous org's models.
//!
//! # Metadata
//!
//! Display name, description, context window, sort order, default and input
//! modalities ride each row as the gateway's presentation block (server
//! commit `e37ea88`, the answer to `docs/requests/gateway-catalogue-
//! metadata.md`). Every member is optional on the wire and falls back per
//! field: the slug is the name, no description, text+image assumed, and —
//! only for a row the gateway has not annotated — no context window, which
//! leaves the engine's auto-compaction off for that row. The gateway serves
//! `context_window` already clamped to its own prompt ceiling, so the number
//! here is always one the engine may compact against.
