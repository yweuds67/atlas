//! Rollout history → thread entries, when a stored session reopens.
//!
//! The fix for the reopened-session bugs lived here all along: the engine's
//! `thread/resume` response has always carried the thread's full turn history
//! out of its rollout files — complete assistant text included — and the seam
//! ignored it. Reopened sessions painted from Atlas's own transcript record
//! instead, which is a byproduct (and for a while a truncated one), while the
//! primary source sat unread in the response.
//!
//! # What is replayed
//!
//! The words, the work, and how the turn ended.
//!
//! Text replays as text, reasoning as thoughts, and every item that maps to a
//! tool call replays as one. Replaying tool calls was once avoided on the
//! grounds that the rollout is lossy for them; that is true only of the legacy
//! history format, which keeps file changes and MCP calls but drops shell
//! commands. A paginated rollout persists every completed item, and an item
//! that never completed is simply absent — so what comes back is a true record
//! either way, just a fuller one on paginated threads.
//!
//! # Why a turn's status matters
//!
//! A process killed mid-turn writes no terminal record, so that turn resumes
//! as `InProgress` carrying whatever text had streamed. Rendering it like any
//! other turn is what made a truncated answer indistinguishable from a
//! finished one: the transcript agreed with the filesystem right up to the
//! point it was cut off, so nothing contradicted a confident partial reply.
//! An unfinished turn therefore ends with a marker of its own, and a failed
//! one with its error.
//!
//! The thread is deliberately left `Idle` rather than marked errored: the
//! retry affordance the marker points at is only offered on an idle session.
//!
//! User text is stripped of Atlas's injected context blocks before it lands:
//! the rollout holds the wire prompt, and the memory machinery prepended to it
//! is not something the user said.
