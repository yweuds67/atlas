//! The `AgentConnection` the app plugs into, over the ported engine.
//!
//! This was the counterpart of the previous native connection, now deleted (#54), and it
//! implements the same trait, because that is the whole point of the seam: the
//! app cannot tell which engine is behind it.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! One in-process app-server runtime per connection. Requests go out through a
//! cloneable handle; events come back on a single stream that only one owner
//! can read, so a pump task owns the client and everything else holds the
//! handle. That split is forced by the facade (`next_event` takes `&mut self`)
//! and it happens to be the right shape anyway — the pump is the one place
//! engine events become thread updates.
//!
//! # Why a turn needs both a response and a notification
//!
//! `turn/start` returns as soon as the turn is *accepted*, carrying a turn id
//! and `status: InProgress` — the permission-request test upstream proves it,
//! since it reads a server request only after the response has landed. The
//! turn's outcome arrives later, as a `TurnCompleted` notification.
//!
//! That splits the turn across two channels, and creates a race that has to be
//! closed rather than avoided: the waiter can only be registered *after* the
//! response, because the response is where the turn id comes from — but the
//! completion travels on the event stream, which is a different task and can
//! get there first. A short turn against a fast provider does exactly that.
//! Registering "before sending" is not available as a fix.
//!
//! So [`TurnWaiters`] buffers completions nobody is waiting for yet, and
//! `register` checks that buffer before it parks. Without it, `prompt` returns
//! a future that never resolves and the composer spins forever on a turn that
//! has already finished.
