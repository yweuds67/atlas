//! Outward actions: the engine's ask before a prompted tool on one of Atlas's
//! own servers, through the approval card (ADR-0014).
//!
//! A tool projected with a per-tool `prompt` (the offer's
//! [`atlas_agent_servers::AskFirst`], projected by `engine::mcp`) stops
//! the engine before the call. The engine does not ask with one of the three
//! approval requests the seam already serves; it asks with an **MCP
//! elicitation** it originates itself — `mcpServer/elicitation/request`, a
//! form with an empty schema and `_meta.atlas_agent_approval_kind =
//! "mcp_tool_call"` (`vendor/atlas-engine/core/src/mcp_tool_call.rs`,
//! `request_mcp_tool_user_approval`, with `tool_call_mcp_elicitation` on by
//! default). This module recognises that one form and nothing else, and joins
//! it to the approval card.
//!
//! # Only the engine's own ask, never a tool server's (ADR-0013)
//!
//! A tool server may send an elicitation too, and ADR-0013 keeps those
//! refused: a server Atlas offers returns candidates and the model asks. The
//! app-server gives the client no request id to tell the two apart, and a
//! server can put any `_meta` it likes on its own elicitation. What it cannot
//! do is be one of the servers the host offered this thread while also being
//! a server that elicits: Atlas's own servers never elicit, so an approval-kind
//! form naming one of them can only be the engine asking about a call to it.
//! That is the whole test ([`is_engine_tool_approval`]); anything else is
//! refused exactly as before.
//!
//! # What the card shows
//!
//! The elicitation says which server and which arguments, not which tool, and
//! not whom the call reaches. The tool comes from the call itself: the engine
//! announces the call (`item/started`, applied to the thread on the pump
//! before this request is handled) and then asks, so the call waiting on the
//! thread with this server and these exact arguments is the one being asked
//! about ([`waiting_call`]). Whom it reaches is the host's to say — a comment
//! id is not a person — so the host describes it
//! ([`atlas_agent_servers::SessionMcpServers::describe_call`]): a title naming
//! the act and the recipient, the recipient in full, and the full body. The
//! card attaches to the call's own row, as a command approval does to its
//! command, and keeps the row's tool name so the row still reads as the call.
//!
//! # Preparing, then the card
//!
//! Describing a call can take several network reads, and the card must never
//! be raised without its description: an outward action is approved on
//! exactly the recipient and words that will be posted. So a **preparing**
//! card goes up at once — the call's row, "Preparing the approval…", and only
//! Decline — and is replaced by the described card (the same call, re-raised
//! with its options, `AcpThread::reraise_tool_call_authorization`) when the
//! host answers. No timeout turns it into anything else: the user can decline
//! while it prepares. Only a host that says it cannot describe the call, or
//! is still silent after [`PREPARE_WITHIN`], ends the ask — refused, with
//! nothing sent.
//!
//! # Allow for this session
//!
//! Not for a tool the host declares asks **every time**
//! ([`atlas_agent_servers::AskFirst::every_time`]): a message's card has no
//! such option, since an allowance would cover any later recipient and body.
//! For the others, the engine keeps no session approval for a `prompt` tool — its session key
//! exists only for `auto` tools, and it folds "allow for session" into a plain
//! allow for `prompt` (`normalize_approval_decision_for_mode`). So the seam
//! remembers it: after "Allow for this session", the next call to the same
//! tool in the same session is answered yes with no card, and the engine still
//! asked, so the audit row and the engine's own record are unchanged.
//!
//! # The approval is recorded for the tool server
//!
//! The engine's ask is not the only gate: in bypass mode it approves every
//! prompted tool itself and never asks. So each call the user does approve —
//! on its card, or covered by "Allow for this session" — is reported to the
//! host ([`atlas_agent_servers::SessionMcpServers::approved_call`]) just before
//! the engine hears yes, and the host's server posts only a call it finds
//! approved ([`atlas_agent_servers::OutwardConsent`]). A call the engine ran
//! unasked was never reported, and is refused there.
//!
//! # A rejection
//!
//! Decline is `action: decline`; the engine answers the model "user rejected
//! MCP tool call" as the call's error and never calls the tool. Dismissing the
//! card is `cancel`; the engine does the same with "user cancelled MCP tool
//! call".
