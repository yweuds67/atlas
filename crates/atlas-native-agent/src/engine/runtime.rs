//! Starting the engine in-process.
//!
//! ADR-0004's surface, in one function. Everything the stdio transport would
//! assemble from ambient process state is passed in here explicitly, because
//! the in-process entry performs none of it (spec open question 3): no OTel
//! provider is built, no socket lock is taken, and the SQLite state handle is
//! whatever the caller supplies.
//!
//! That property is the reason this is a short file rather than a careful
//! sequence of things to neutralise.
//!
//! # Why the engine gets its own runtime
//!
//! One thing *does* have to be arranged, and it is not obvious: **stack size.**
//!
//! The engine's futures are enormous. Upstream knows it — `atlas-engine-core` boxes
//! its config load with the note "Keep the large config-loading future off
//! small runtime thread stacks", and `atlas-engine-arg0`, which is how every upstream
//! binary starts, builds its Tokio runtime with
//! `TOKIO_WORKER_STACK_SIZE_BYTES = 16 MiB` instead of the 2 MiB default. Every
//! upstream's shipped frontends therefore ran on 16 MiB workers without ever saying
//! so out loud.
//!
//! Atlas does not use `arg0` (that is the point of the embedding), and ADR-0004
//! has it adopt the *host* runtime — which is Tauri's, with default-size
//! workers. Handing the engine those is not a subtle degradation: `thread/start`
//! overflows the stack and the process **aborts**. Not an error a `Result`
//! carries; a `SIGABRT` with the whole app attached to it.
//!
//! Boxing futures on Atlas's side does not fix it, and the reason is worth
//! keeping: the overflow is not on the caller's stack. The engine hands
//! `thread/start` to its own `MessageProcessor` task, so the frame that runs
//! out of room belongs to a task Atlas never awaits.
//!
//! So the seam owns a Tokio runtime for the engine, built with upstream's own
//! 16 MiB figure. Engine work is spawned onto it, which is what makes every
//! task the engine spawns from inside inherit it. The app's own runtime is
//! untouched, and requests cross between the two over channels, which are
//! runtime-agnostic.
