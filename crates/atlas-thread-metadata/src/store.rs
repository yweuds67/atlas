//! The store: an in-memory index of every thread, a queued writer behind it.
//!
//! Ported from Zed's `ThreadMetadataStore`
//! (`thread_metadata_store.rs:497-1360`). Two properties are worth stating
//! because everything else follows from them:
//!
//! * **Reads never touch SQLite.** The whole table is loaded at open and kept
//!   in memory, indexed by thread id, by folder-path list, by main-worktree
//!   path list and by session id. The sidebar re-queries on every keystroke;
//!   it must cost nothing.
//! * **Writes are queued, batched and deduped to the last operation per
//!   thread.** A streaming turn updates one row dozens of times a second; only
//!   the last one is worth a disk write (`:1214-1263`).
//!
//! Divergence from Zed, deliberately: Zed stores the native agent's id as SQL
//! `NULL` and decodes it back (`:1499-1503`, `:1725-1727`). Atlas writes every
//! `agent_id` literally. Special-casing one agent in the storage layer is
//! exactly the shape the "no ACP agent gets special treatment" rule forbids,
//! and the column costs the same either way.
//!
//! Divergence from Zed, structural: Zed's queue drains on a GPUI background
//! task and its callers are async. Atlas has no such ambient runtime here, so
//! the queue drains on a plain thread and [`ThreadMetadataStore::flush`] exists
//! to wait for it — at shutdown, and in tests. That is the whole of the
//! difference; the batching and dedup rules are Zed's.
