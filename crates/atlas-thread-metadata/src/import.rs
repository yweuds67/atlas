//! Importing an agent's own sessions — the only way external history reaches
//! Atlas.
//!
//! Ported from Zed's `thread_import.rs` (`collect_all_sessions` `:794-820`,
//! `collect_importable_threads` `:855-889`). Two properties carry it:
//!
//! * **Metadata only.** A `SessionInfo` is an id, a directory, a title and a
//!   timestamp. No transcript is fetched, here or ever — the conversation
//!   arrives when the user opens the row, replayed by the agent through
//!   `session/load`.
//! * **Imports land archived.** They go to the history view, not the active
//!   sidebar, so pulling in a year of sessions never buries the work in front
//!   of you (`thread_import.rs:884`).
//!
//! Nothing in this file knows an agent's name. Whether an agent can be imported
//! from at all is decided by whether its connection hands back a session list,
//! which happens only when it advertised `sessionCapabilities.list`.
