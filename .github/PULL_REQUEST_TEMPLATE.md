Thanks for the PR. Please read CONTRIBUTING.md if you haven't already.

## Which branch should this target?

Atlas ships versioned installable builds, so `main` always equals the latest
release — work collects on a version branch (e.g. `0.2.5`) first, and the
merge of that branch into `main` is the release itself.

- Target the **current version branch** for anything that isn't a small,
  self-contained fix.
- Target **`main`** directly only if the change has no version-branch
  dependency and doesn't need to wait for the next release (a doc fix, a
  one-line hotfix).

See CONTRIBUTING.md's "Branching model" section if you're not sure which
applies.

## Checklist

Only the things CI can't check for you:

- [ ] Targets the current version branch, unless it's a small standalone fix
- [ ] New behaviour has a test; a bug fix has a test that fails without it
- [ ] You've run the app and used the change in a window

CI runs, on every PR: `bun run lint`, `bun run format:check`, `bun run
typecheck`, `bun run test` and `bun run build`; `cargo test` plus one clippy
pass for every crate under `crates/`, each in its own job (`-D warnings` for
the crates flagged `clippy: true` in `ci.yml`, the workspace lint table for the
rest), plus a Windows-target clippy pass for the crates flagged `cross`;
`cargo test --lib` and clippy for `src-tauri` on macOS, and clippy for it on
Linux and Windows; and the engine
dialect (`atlas-engine-api`) with the vendored crates Atlas has edited. So there are no
boxes for those. Locally, `bun run test:rust` runs a subset of CI's Rust tests
(its header says what it skips) and no clippy. `bun run ci:local` runs what CI
would for your branch, clippy included, and sends the jobs that need Linux to a
container.
What CI still can't judge is whether the change actually works in a window, and
whether the behaviour you added is covered by a test.

If this adds a top-level dependency or touches the telemetry pipeline, say so in **Why?** above — both need discussion, and telemetry changes need `TELEMETRY.md` updated to match.
