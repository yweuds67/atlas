//! `AtlasConfig` — the human- and agent-editable settings file.
//!
//! Replaces `AppState.settings` (formerly the `settings` object inside
//! `state.json`). Lives at `~/.config/atlas/config.toml`: TOML rather than
//! JSON specifically so the file can carry comments, and so a patch (from the
//! Settings UI or the `atlas-self-configure` skill) can preserve them —
//! `toml_edit` edits the document key-by-key instead of reserializing the
//! whole thing the way a JSON round-trip would.
//!
//! Two representations are kept in sync inside [`ConfigManager`]:
//!   - `document` (`toml_edit::DocumentMut`) — the actual on-disk text,
//!     mutated key-by-key so untouched comments/formatting/unknown keys
//!     survive a patch.
//!   - `effective` ([`AppSettings`]) — the typed, validated snapshot every
//!     other module reads. Derived from `document` by round-tripping through
//!     `toml` (cheap; this file is a few hundred bytes).
//!
//! Validation is all-or-nothing: a candidate document is parsed and validated
//! in full before it ever replaces `effective` or touches disk. A malformed
//! external edit — or a bad patch — never displaces the last-known-good state,
//! and this module never repairs/renames/overwrites a malformed file on its
//! own; [`ConfigManager::reset`] is the sole authorized "recreate defaults"
//! path, and it backs up whatever was there first.
//!
//! Scope (see the issue #64 design record): only the preferences that used to
//! live in `AppState.settings` move here. Telemetry identity (`device.json`),
//! the self-hosted PostHog override (`telemetry.json`), and BYOK (the user's
//! shell profile) are deliberately untouched — their separation from
//! coarse-write settings state already fixed a real bug (see
//! `crate::telemetry::device`) or was never Atlas-owned to begin with.
