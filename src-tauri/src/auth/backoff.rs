//! The retry schedule for the INDETERMINATE class (ATL-48).
//!
//! Only failures that told us *nothing* about the credential come here. A 401
//! is answered by signing out and a 403 by doing nothing at all; neither ever
//! reaches this module. See [`crate::auth::AuthFailure`] for the split.
//!
//! The schedule is exponential from one second to a five-minute ceiling, with
//! jitter, and **no attempt limit**: a laptop closed on a plane and opened six
//! hours later must come back signed in on its own, without the user
//! restarting Atlas or redoing the device grant. An attempt cap would turn that
//! into a silent dead end that looks exactly like being signed out.
//!
//! The ceiling is also what keeps the retry path clear of the auth worker's
//! global rate limit — 100 requests per 60-second window across every
//! `/api/auth/*` path, keyed by IP, so an office behind one NAT shares the
//! budget. At the ceiling this loop costs 12 requests an hour. Anyone
//! shortening the ceiling should re-check it against that number.
