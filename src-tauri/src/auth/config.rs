//! Resolution order, highest priority first:
//!   1. env `ATLAS_AUTH_URL` — how a developer points at `wrangler dev`.

//! on-disk override of the *sign-in* host is a phishing foothold in a way an
//! analytics host is not — one stray file write and every future sign-in goes
//! to an attacker. An environment variable at least requires code execution in
//! the user's session at launch time.
