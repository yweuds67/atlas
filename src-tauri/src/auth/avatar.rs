//! Fetching and caching the profile photo.
//!
//! The photo is fetched **once**, when the remote URL first appears or changes,
//! and read from disk on every launch after that. The point is not speed: the
//! provider URL points at Google or GitHub, and re-fetching on every launch
//! would hand one of them a beacon carrying the user's IP and a rough activity
//! log, for a picture we already have. That is the opposite of what a
//! local-first app should do, and it would also blank the title bar on a plane.
//!
//! The claim is precisely "never for a photo we already have", not "never".
//! When there is no cached file — a first sign-in, or a photo that has failed
//! to download so far — every launch does try again, unbounded. That is the
//! deliberate side of the trade: caching a *failure* would mean one CDN outage
//! during sign-in costs the user their photo until they next change it. The
//! request only recurs while we have nothing to show, and a launch already
//! talks to the Atlas auth server twice regardless.
//!
//! The remote URL is therefore the cache key, and it never crosses to the
//! frontend — an `<img src>` pointed at the provider would reinstate exactly
//! the per-launch request this module exists to avoid. The frontend gets a
//! local path.
//!
//! Every failure here is non-fatal by construction: the caller gets `None` and
//! renders initials. A photo is never worth blocking or failing a sign-in for.
