//! `compose_prompt` — turn (user prose, list of @-mentions) into the
//! final wire string sent to the agent.
//!
//! Used to live in `src/features/chat/lib/mentions.ts::composePrompt`:
//! N sequential `invoke("read_file_content")` calls (one IPC per
//! mention) + JS string assembly. For a message with 5 mentions
//! that's 5 round-trips JS → Tauri → file read → IPC → JS before the
//! agent even sees the prompt.
//!
//! Now: one Tauri command. File reads fan out in parallel on the
//! tokio blocking pool, the wire string is assembled in Rust, the
//! frontend just ships `(prose, mentions[])` and awaits the composed
//! result. Net IPC roundtrips per send: 1 (was N+1).
