//! The **UI tool server**: Atlas Agent's way to act on the Atlas window
//! (ADR-0012). A second MCP service beside the memory tool server, on the
//! same loopback listener, behind the same token check and the same
//! per-session token — the token store binds one token per session, so a
//! second minted token would revoke the memory one.
//!
//! - **Offered only to a connection that carries UI control**
//!   ([`offers`]): today the in-process native connection. Never decided by
//!   agent identity.
//! - **Every call is one UI action** ([`bridge`]): emitted to the window as
//!   [`UI_ACTION_EVENT`], performed by the frontend through the app's own
//!   openers and store actions, answered by [`ui_action_respond`]. Rust
//!   forwards the frontend's JSON verbatim and mirrors no UI state — the
//!   frontend owns layout and focus (ARCHITECTURE.md). An action the window
//!   does not answer in time is a tool error, never a hung turn.
//! - **Gated by the user's navigation setting** ([`NavigationGate`]), at
//!   offer time and on every call.
