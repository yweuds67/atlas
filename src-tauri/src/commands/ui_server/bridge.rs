//! One UI action's round trip: Rust asks the window, the window answers.
//!
//! The elicitation pattern (`atlas-acp-thread`'s `elicitation.rs`): a
//! one-shot reply parked under a request id, the request emitted to the
//! webview, the answer delivered by a command. Every way it can go wrong —
//! the emit fails, the window never answers, the reply is dropped — ends in
//! an error the model can read, so a tool call never hangs a turn.
