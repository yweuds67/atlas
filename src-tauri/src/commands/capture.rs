//! Wiring `atlas-checkpoint` into the running app.
//!
//! The crate itself is Tauri-free and knows nothing about agents. This module is
//! the adapter: it turns the agent delta stream into capture calls, and owns the
//! per-Project stores.
//!
//! Three decisions here are not obvious from the crate's API, and all three come
//! from how the runtime actually behaves rather than from how it reads:
//!
//! **Capture is a pipeline stage, not a bus subscriber.** The `atlas-bus`
//! broadcast drops events for a subscriber that lags past the ring capacity —
//! correct for the UI fan-out, where a dropped frame is invisible, and wrong
//! here, where a dropped event is a turn missing from the permanent record. The
//! [`OutboundPipeline`] slot runs synchronously on the emit thread and cannot
//! lag by construction. (`atlas_bus::middleware` has a test pinning that
//! contrast.)
//!
//! **The user's prompt does not arrive on the delta stream.** The session actor
//! deliberately skips emitting a message-appended delta for user messages — the
//! frontend adds them optimistically — and turn start is a status flip carrying
//! no text. A delta subscriber alone would therefore produce Sessions with no
//! prompts and no titles. [`note_prompt`] is called from the send path instead,
//! with the text the user actually typed, *before* Atlas's memory-injection
//! blocks are prepended: injected context is machinery, not something the user
//! said, and titling a Session after it would be nonsense.
//!
//! **Writes happen on one owned thread, not on the emit thread.** SQLite work is
//! disk work and the streaming hot path must never block on it, but
//! `spawn_blocking` would also let two turns land out of order. A single worker
//! thread behind an unbounded channel gets both properties: `on_event` returns
//! immediately, and turns are written in the order they happened.
//!
//! **Streamed bodies are accumulated, not sampled.** `MessageAppended` carries
//! only the *first* streamed chunk of an assistant or thinking message; the rest
//! arrives as `TextChunk` / `ThinkingChunk` deltas. Recording at
//! `MessageAppended` time would therefore store every streamed response
//! truncated to its opening tokens — so the middleware accumulates per message
//! id and submits the completed bodies when the turn finishes.
