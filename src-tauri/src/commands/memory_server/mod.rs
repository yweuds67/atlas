//! The **memory tool server**: shared memory as MCP tools, served by the
//! Tauri backend itself over streamable HTTP on loopback. It is the only way
//! memory reaches an agent — nothing is prepended to a prompt (ADR-0010).
//!
//! - **One server per app**, bound to `127.0.0.1` on a port the OS picks. The
//!   app starts it at setup on the async runtime, so the main thread never
//!   waits on it ([`MemoryServerHost::start`]).
//! - **One bearer token per (session, scope)** ([`tokens`]): minted when a
//!   session starts, revoked when it ends, checked on every request. The
//!   token says who is calling and which scope's record to open.
//! - **Handed to every agent that can take it** ([`offers`]): ACP agents that
//!   advertise `mcpCapabilities.http`, and the native agent through its
//!   thread's engine config.
//! - **Seven tools** ([`tools`]), read first, write last: `memory_briefing`,
//!   `memory_changes`, `memory_search`, `memory_get`, `memory_list`,
//!   `memory_remember`, `memory_forget`. The server's instructions
//!   ([`INSTRUCTIONS`]) tell the agent when to call each — the briefing first
//!   in every session — because with nothing pushed, the protocol is what
//!   makes memory reach the model.
//! - **What a session has seen** ([`briefing`]): a per-session clock behind
//!   `memory_changes`, so a resumed agent asks for the delta rather than the
//!   whole record again.
//! - **Failure is "no memory", never a crash.** A read that fails returns an
//!   empty result; a write that fails returns a tool error the agent can read.
