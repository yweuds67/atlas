//! `memory_indexer` — the decoupled background indexing infrastructure (Step 4).
//!
//! Two pieces live here, both in the Tauri app layer (never in `atlas-memory`,
//! which stays Tauri-free):
//!
//! - [`MemoryRegistry`] — a `cwd → Arc<RwLock<MemoryEngine>>` map stored as a
//!   Tauri managed `State`. It is the **single owner** of each project's engine:
//!   the retrieve closure (Step 6, read lock) and the indexer (write lock) both
//!   reach the right engine through it. Opening a project for the first time
//!   loads its persisted index, starts an FS watcher, and enqueues an initial
//!   cold [`Job::IndexCorpus`].
//! - [`MemoryIndexer`] — one owned Tokio task draining a **bounded** `mpsc` queue.
//!   Every [`Job`] carries a `cwd` so projects stay isolated: corpus indexing,
//!   the extractor's passes (turn finished and session end, see
//!   `super::memory_extract`), and global promotion (`Compact`).
//!
//! Heavy work (corpus gather + embed + persist) runs off the IPC thread on the
//! async runtime / blocking pool; the FS watcher coalesces bursts via a ~2s
//! debounce into a single `IndexCorpus` per project.
