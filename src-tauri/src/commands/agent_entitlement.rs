//! Does this account have AI access? (spec D15a, acceptance bar item 14)
//!
//! A signed-in user whose organisation has not been granted AI access is not
//! having a failure — they are having a **setup problem**, and the gateway says
//! so in as many words: `403 no_entitlement` is "a setup problem, not a
//! failure". Rendered as an error toast it reads as something broken, and the
//! user goes looking for a switch to flip. There is no such switch; an admin
//! has to grant it.
//!
//! # Why this is asked before a turn rather than learned from one
//!
//! The alternative is to classify the error that comes back from a prompt. That
//! works, and it is too late: the user has already typed a message, watched it
//! send and watched it fail. The gateway's `GET /models` is entitlement-filtered
//! — it answers with exactly the set `POST /chat/completions` will accept, or
//! `403` when there is no grant at all — so the question can be answered before
//! anyone types anything.
//!
//! # Unknown is not the same as no-grant
//!
//! Offline, a timeout, or a shape the gateway has never returned all mean "we
//! could not find out". Rendering those as "your account needs AI access" would
//! send a user to their admin over a dropped Wi-Fi connection. Only an explicit
//! `403` says no.
