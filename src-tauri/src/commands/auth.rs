//! Tauri adapters over [`crate::auth::AuthCore`].
//!
//! Thin by design: translate arguments, spawn the poll task, emit events. Every
//! decision worth testing lives in `crate::auth`, which is why there are no
//! tests here — this layer holds no logic of its own.
//!
//! Events emitted to the frontend:
//!   `atlas:auth-changed`    — the full [`AuthSnapshot`], on every transition
//!   `atlas:auth-error`      — `{ message }` when a grant ends without a token
//!   `atlas:auth-signed-out` — `{ message }` when the server ended the session
//!
//! All go out via `app.emit`, which broadcasts to **every** window, so a
//! multi-window install always agrees about who is signed in.
//!
//! `auth-error` and `auth-signed-out` are separate because they are read in
//! different places: a grant failure belongs inside the connect dialog the user
//! is already looking at, while a revoked session arrives with nothing on
//! screen and has to reach them as a toast.
