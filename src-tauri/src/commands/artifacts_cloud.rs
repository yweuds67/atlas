//! The Timeline's cloud half: the bridge between `atlas-artifacts` and the
//! renderer.
//!
//! Every route to the ingest service goes through here because only Rust holds
//! the Bearer. The renderer invokes these commands and applies the events
//! emitted on [`ARTIFACTS_EVENT`]; it decides nothing.
//!
//! # What lives here and what does not
//!
//! Pushing Sessions is `atlas_checkpoint::sync`, driven from
//! [`crate::commands::capture`]. This module only ever **reads** — remote
//! Sessions, comments — and holds the realtime sockets. Two modules with the
//! right to say a row was sent would be one too many.
//!
//! # The refresh is not on the read path
//!
//! [`artifacts_board`](crate::commands::capture::artifacts_board) merges the
//! cache synchronously and never awaits the network, so the board stays instant
//! and still renders local Sessions with no connection at all. Filling the
//! cache is this module's job, on a ticker and from the socket.
