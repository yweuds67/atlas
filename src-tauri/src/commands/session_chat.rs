//! Session-Chat — grounded chat over one recorded Session.
//!
//! The Timeline's detail view *shows* everything a Session recorded; this
//! answers questions about it. "What changed in `capture.rs`", "review this
//! session", "what was `3d97807` for" — all questions whose answers are already
//! in the store and take six hundred rows of scrolling to assemble by hand.
//!
//! **Retrieval only.** Generation goes through the existing BYOK provider path
//! (`modelchat_send`), exactly as Memory ▸ Chat's provider mode does: this
//! command returns an augmented prompt and the frontend streams it. Nothing here
//! talks to a network.
//!
//! ## Why lexical and not embeddings
//!
//! A Session is a *bounded* corpus — hundreds of entries, not a codebase — and
//! the questions people ask about one are dominated by exact terms: a file path,
//! a commit SHA, a tool name. BM25 is precise for exactly that, costs nothing to
//! run, and needs no model download, so the API key is the only thing standing
//! between a user and the feature. The seam is one function ([`rank`]) if that
//! ever needs to become a vector search.
//!
//! ## What the model is given
//!
//! Three layers, in descending order of certainty:
//!
//! 1. **The brief** — always present. Metrics, every Checkpoint with its real
//!    SHA and diffstat, the tool tally, and the file-touch table. This alone
//!    answers "what changed here" and "what was each commit for", so those
//!    questions never depend on retrieval finding the right rows.
//! 2. **Exact hits** — payloads for any path or SHA named in the question, plus
//!    the actual commit diff for that path from git.
//! 3. **Ranked entries** — the top-scoring conversation and tool entries.
//!
//! When the budget runs out, layer 3 is dropped before layer 2 and layer 1 is
//! never dropped: a thinner answer beats a confidently wrong one.

You are answering questions about ONE recorded coding session, using only the record below.

Rules:
- Ground every claim in the record. If it does not contain the answer, say so plainly \

- Cite commits by their short SHA and files by their path, so the reader can jump to them.
- Numbers (line counts, token counts, durations) come from the record verbatim. Never estimate one.
- When a diagram genuinely clarifies the answer, emit a ```mermaid fenced block. Do not \
