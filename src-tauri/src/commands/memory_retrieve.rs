//! Shared memory — retrieval over the project's **memory index** (the same
//! MiniLM vector store the Memory ▸ Graph / Chat features build).
//!
//! `memory_search` on the memory tool server answers from it alongside the
//! record, so every agent that takes the server reaches the long-term index
//! through one tool (ADR-0010: nothing is pushed per turn any more).
//!
//! Retrieval runs through the fused `MemoryEngine` (HNSW + graph) using the
//! single app-wide MiniLM provider held by [`MemoryRegistry`] — the same
//! instance the indexer, graph, query and chat share, so the model is never
//! re-loaded here. **Strictly best-effort**: a missing model, an unbuilt
//! index, or any error is a silent empty result, and the whole call is
//! time-bounded so it can never stall a tool call.
