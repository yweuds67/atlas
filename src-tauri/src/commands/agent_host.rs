//! The seam between the ported ACP stack and the `agents_*` command surface.
//!
//! [`AgentHost`] is what `commands/agents.rs` talks to. It owns the ported
//! [`AgentManager`], the [`DeltaProjector`] that turns thread events into the
//! session-delta wire, and the two pieces of bookkeeping the ported stack deliberately
//! does not do:
//!
//! 1. **Identity.** The frontend has always addressed an agent by a per-spawn
//!    `AgentId` (a uuid) and a session by `SessionKey { agent_id, session_id }`.
//!    The ported manager keys connections by [`Agent`] (`Native` or a stable
//!    string id) and sessions by `acp::SessionId`. This module holds the map
//!    between the two, so the whole TS surface keeps working unchanged.
//! 2. **History.** Every conversation's metadata row in the app-owned
//!    thread-metadata store is kept current from the same thread events the
//!    wire projection reads (ADR-0001). The row is metadata only; the
//!    transcript stays with the agent.
//! 3. **Session metadata.** `snapshot_meta` has to answer
//!    `{plugin_id, cwd, current_model}` cheaply on the send path — checkpoint
//!    touchpoint #3 depends on it — and turn identity is stamped here, at send
//!    time, not by the thread (touchpoint #6).
//!
//! # No default agents
//!
//! There is no builtin table, no auto-acquire, and no spawn ladder (research
//! ADR-0002). The native agent is always present because it is
//! in-process; every other agent exists only because the installed map says so.
//! [`AgentHost::agent_for`] is the whole of that policy, and it is four lines.
