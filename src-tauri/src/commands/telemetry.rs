//! Tauri command surface for telemetry. The heavy lifting lives in
//! `crate::telemetry`; these just expose the managed `TelemetryClient` to the
//! renderer so it can (a) bootstrap `posthog-js` with the same anonymous id and
//! resolved key/host, (b) flip the live opt-in gate when the user toggles the
//! setting, and (c) optionally route an event through Rust.
