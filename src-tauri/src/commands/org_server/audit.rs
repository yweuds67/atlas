//! The audit trail of the organisation tool server: one record for every
//! call, whatever it answered (ADR-0014, after ADR-0012's contract for UI
//! actions). A UI action is performed by the window, so the window writes its
//! own Logs row; an organisation call never crosses to the window, so the
//! record is made here, once, in the tool dispatch — every tool, the refusals
//! before any tool runs, and the failures after — and handed to an
//! [`OrgAudit`] sink. The app's sink emits it as [`ORG_ACTION_EVENT`], and the
//! window turns it into the call's Logs row; the tests keep it.
//!
//! The record names the call and carries what the model was answered, and no
//! more. What a row says about it (the member, the conversation, the
//! organisation) is decided on the window's side, from the same table that
//! names the call's tool row in the chat, so the two never read differently.
