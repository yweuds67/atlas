//! Whether a session request is handed the organisation tool server, and in

//! The memory tool server's offer ([`MemorySessionOffers`]) makes the

//! UI server's module doc); this is the organisation third of it. Unlike the
//! other two it yields something besides yes or no: the [`OrgScope`] the
//! Project is bound to, which the offer stamps on the session's grant.
