//! The **organisation tool server**: Atlas Agent's way to read the
//! organisation a session's Project belongs to, and to act in it as the
//! signed-in user (ADR-0014). The third MCP service on the memory tool
//! server's loopback listener, beside the UI tool server, behind the same
//! token check and on the same per-session token — the token store binds one
//! token per session, so a second minted token would revoke the first.
//!
//! - **Offered only to a connection that carries organisation access**
//!   ([`offers`]): today the in-process native connection, never an ACP one,
//!   and never decided by agent identity. Also only while the user lets the
//!   agent act in the organisation, is signed in, and the session's Project is
//!   bound to a Workspace.
//! - **Acts in the organisation the Project is bound to** ([`OrgScope`]),
//!   resolved from the Project's binding when the offer is decided and carried
//!   on the session's grant. The app's active and chat organisations are not
//!   consulted, so a switch in the window cannot redirect a call mid-turn.
//! - **Every remote operation goes through one seam** ([`OrganisationCloud`]):
//!   the production adapter ([`AppOrganisationCloud`]) over the artifacts
//!   client, the chat client and the auth core, which already hold the bearer
//!   in Rust; an in-memory organisation in the tests. The tool handlers
//!   ([`tools`]) never touch a client.
//! - **Gated by the user's organisation-access setting**
//!   ([`OrgAccessGate`]), at offer time and on every call, so switching it off
//!   stops a running session at its next call — and likewise by the account
//!   and the Project's binding ([`SessionOrgs`]): signing out, or the Project
//!   leaving the grant's organisation or Workspace, refuses the next call.
//!
//! - **Names become ids in one place** ([`resolve`]): a member or a
//!   conversation the model names is resolved against the roster or the
//!   conversation list, and more than one match comes back as candidates for
//!   the model to ask about, never a guess. A composer mention arrives as an
//!   organisation link ([`OrgLink`]) carrying the id, which every tool that
//!   takes a member, a conversation or a recorded session reads first.
//!
//! - **Every call is audited** ([`audit`]): one [`OrgActionRecord`] per call,
//!   made in the tool dispatch and emitted to the window as
//!   [`ORG_ACTION_EVENT`] for its Logs panel — refusals and failures too.
//!
//! - **Outward actions ask first** (ADR-0014): a tool that reaches another
//!   person — `org_comment_reply` and `org_send` ([`OUTWARD_TOOLS`]) — is
//!   declared on the offer as asking first, projected by the native seam
//!   with a per-tool `prompt`, and the offer describes the waiting call for
//!   the approval card ([`OrgTools::describe`]): whom it reaches, and the
//!   full body. The seam reports each call the user approves through the host
//!   into the tools' [`OutwardConsent`](atlas_agent_servers::OutwardConsent),
//!   and the tool posts only a call found there — so a call the engine runs
//!   without asking (bypass mode) is refused and nothing is sent.
//!
//! - **Some tools cross to the window** ([`WINDOW_TOOLS`]): drawing on a
//!   Space page is done by the frontend, where the page's codec lives, through
//!   the UI tool server's bridge (ADR-0012) — emitted as
//!   [`ORG_WINDOW_ACTION_EVENT`], answered through `ui_action_respond`. The
//!   arguments are checked here first, so the window is only asked to draw a
//!   document that can be drawn; a window that does not answer in time is a
//!   tool error, never a hung turn.
//!
//! `org_whoami`, `org_members`, `org_conversations`, `org_inbox`, `org_comments`,
//! `org_comment_resolve`, `org_comment_reply`, `org_sessions`, `org_session`,
//! `org_page_create`, `org_page_write`, `org_send` and (admins only, [`ADMIN_TOOLS`])
//! `org_member_activity` exist so far; the rest of the thirteen tools the spec names are
//! added on this skeleton.
