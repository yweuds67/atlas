//! The MCP surface of the organisation tool server: the tools, their
//! instructions, and the handler that answers each call through the
//! organisation cloud.
//!
//! Every call is checked before anything remote happens, as the offer was:
//! the user's organisation-access setting (off stops a running session at its
//! next call), the grant's organisation (a token that was not offered the
//! server names none, and is refused), that someone is still signed in, and
//! that the grant's Project is still bound to the grant's organisation and
//! Workspace. What a tool then asks the cloud, it asks in the grant's
//! organisation — in the grant's Workspace unless the tool names another of
//! the organisation's — never in the window's. An outward action is
//! also checked for the user's approval of that exact call
//! ([`OutwardConsent`]).
//! Schemas are kept flat, with one-clause descriptions, because every native
//! turn carries them in its fixed prefix.
//!
//! This module holds the server itself: the tool list, the instructions, the
//! per-call checks and dispatch, the argument readers, and the shapes and
//! resolvers more than one area shares. Each area's tools live beside it:
//! [`roster`] (who you are, members, conversations), [`inbox`],
//! [`comments`] (threads, resolving, replying), [`messages`] (sending),
//! [`mentions`] (members named in what is posted, and read back),
//! [`sessions`] (the recorded work), [`activity`] (a member's recorded
//! activity, for admins), [`spaces`] (pages in a conversation's
//! Space, and drawing on one), [`diagram`] (the document a drawing is checked
//! as) and [`describe`] (the approval card for an outward call).
