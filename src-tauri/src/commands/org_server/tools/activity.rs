//! A member's recorded activity, for admins: `org_member_activity`.
//!
//! **Member activity** (CONTEXT.md) is what was recorded through Atlas and
//! nothing else — the recorded sessions, checkpoints, insertions, deletions
//! and Atlas-recorded tokens attributed to one member over a window. It is
//! named and described as recorded activity, never as performance: work done
//! outside Atlas, or in a session nobody recorded, is not in it.
//!
//! The server has no per-member metric, so this is folded here from the
//! Workspace's board by the same walk as `org_sessions`
//! ([`OrgTools::walk_board`]): the same window, the same default, the same
//! scan cap, and the same truncation notes.
//!
//! Admins only. The tool is left out of the tool list offered to any other
//! role ([`ADMIN_TOOLS`](super::ADMIN_TOOLS)), refused here at call time for
//! one that calls it anyway, and a 403 from the server is still answered in
//! words — the role in the access token is a mirror; the server decides.
