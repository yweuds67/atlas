//! The **organisation cloud**: the one seam between the organisation tools and
//! everything remote.
//!
//! Every tool handler reaches the organisation through this trait and through
//! nothing else — no handler holds a client, mints a token or opens a store.
//! Production implements it over the clients Atlas already has
//! ([`AppOrganisationCloud`]); the tests implement it in memory, holding a
//! roster, a board of recorded sessions and their comments, so every fold,
//! cap, sentinel and refusal is tested through the tool surface the model
//! sees.
//!
//! Every method names the organisation it acts in explicitly, always the one
//! on the session's grant ([`OrgScope`]). An implementation never falls back
//! to whichever organisation the window is showing.
//!
//! Shaped to grow: each later tool adds the method it needs here (the roster,
//! conversations, the board, a recorded session's entries and an entry's
//! payload, replying on and resolving comments, the inbox, sending, creating a
//! DM, creating a Space page), its production half in the adapter and its
//! in-memory half in the tests' fake.
//!
//! [`AppOrganisationCloud`]: super::AppOrganisationCloud
//! [`OrgScope`]: super::OrgScope
