// Upstream emitted WFP setup success/failure counters from this helper, and
// **only** over the built-in Statsig route — the parent process passed the
// resolved Statsig environment down through the elevation payload, and the
// comment on the old `build_wfp_metrics_provider` said other exporters were
// "intentionally omitted from this helper path".
//
// That made this a third phone-home site, independent of core's default
// exporter and of the analytics client: an elevated helper reporting firewall
// setup outcomes to a hardcoded endpoint. #43 (spec D2) removes the route, so
// the emission has nothing left to reach and is gone with it. The outcomes are
// still reported — through the `log` callback the caller already supplies,
// which stays on the machine.
