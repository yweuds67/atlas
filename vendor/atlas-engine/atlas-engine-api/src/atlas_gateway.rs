// Modified by Atlas from upstream OpenAI Codex (Apache-2.0). See CONTEXT.md.
//! Atlas's error-classification arm for the Atlas AI gateway (spec D13).
//!
//! Added by Atlas; upstream has no equivalent, because upstream talks to one
//! provider whose error vocabulary its own classifier already knows.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all
//!
//! The engine's typed retry classification is calibrated to OpenAI's errors,
//! and it lands every gateway-specific code in the wrong bucket. Two of those
//! are actively harmful rather than merely wrong:
//!
//! - **`402 cap_exceeded` would be auto-retried.** The gateway returns `402`
//!   for a filled spend cap *specifically because* stock SDKs auto-retry `429`
//!   with backoff, and a monthly cap answering `429` puts every capped agent
//!   into a retry loop against a wall it cannot clear for up to three weeks.
//!   Anything here that retries a `402` reintroduces exactly the loop the
//!   gateway's status choice was made to prevent.
//! - **`429 rate_limited` would be abandoned instantly, and its `Retry-After`
//!   ignored** — the one case where waiting is not only safe but instructed.
//!
//! # Branch on `code`, never on `message`
//!
//! The gateway says so, and it is right: messages are diagnostic and change.
//! One status carries several meanings that need opposite handling — `401` is
//! either "re-authenticate" or "refresh once", and `403` is three different
//! terminal reasons — so the status alone is not enough either.
