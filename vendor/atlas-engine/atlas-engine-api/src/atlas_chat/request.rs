// Modified by Atlas from upstream OpenAI Codex (Apache-2.0). See CONTEXT.md.
//! The Chat Completions request body, built for the Atlas gateway (spec D3).
//!
//! Added by Atlas. Upstream deleted its Chat Completions dialect deliberately —
//! `wire_api = "chat"` fails to deserialize with an error pointing at the
//! removal discussion — so there was nothing to resurrect and this is authored
//! from scratch against the gateway contract (`docs/reference/atlas-ai-api.md`).
//!
//! # The rule this file exists to enforce
//!
//! The gateway rejects **anything not on its forwarded allowlist**, nested
//! unknown keys included, with a `400` rather than a silent drop. Ten of the
//! fifteen fields the Responses builder sends today are off that list, so a
//! request assembled the old way fails outright. The defence here is
//! structural rather than a filter: the request *type* has only allowlisted
//! fields, so there is no field to forget to strip. [`ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_KEYS`]
//! and the test below are what keep that true as the type changes.
//!
//! # `max_tokens` is never absent
//!
//! Absence is not "no limit" here — the gateway injects `4,096`, counted
//! *reasoning-inclusive*, which silently truncates a reasoning-heavy agent turn
//! and looks like the model stopping early. So the field is non-optional in the
//! type.
//!
//! # Six parameters are refused on Claude
//!
//! `temperature`, `top_p`, `seed`, `presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty` and
//! `response_format` are on the forwarded list but are a `400 invalid_parameter`
//! on Claude models — which the default `claude-sonnet-4-6` is. Five of them
//! this builder never emits at all. `response_format` it *would* emit, for a
//! schema-constrained turn — so a schema-constrained turn against a Claude
//! model is **refused here**, with an error naming the limit.
//!
//! Refusing is the harder-looking choice and the right one. Dropping the schema
//! and sending the turn anyway returns free text where the caller asked for
//! JSON, bills them for it, and gives them nothing to connect the two — the
//! precise failure the gateway's own allowlist rule exists to prevent
//! ("Silently dropping is the failure this rule exists to prevent"). The
//! gateway would answer the same request with a `400` anyway; this says so one
//! round trip earlier, and says which parameter and why.
