// Modified by Atlas from upstream OpenAI Codex (Apache-2.0). See CONTEXT.md.
//! The Chat Completions stream, read the way the Atlas gateway writes it.
//!
//! Added by Atlas; the Responses machine next door cannot read this wire. Its
//! terminal event is `response.completed`, `data: [DONE]` is a line it skips as
//! unparseable, and the gateway's in-stream error frame has no top-level `type`
//! so it is skipped too — leaving a caller with "stream closed before
//! response.completed" in place of the gateway's own diagnosis.
//!
//! # `200` means the stream started, not that it succeeded
//!
//! The gateway's rule, and the reason this machine fails closed:
//!
//! - a mid-stream failure emits `data: {"error":…}` **and withholds
//!   `data: [DONE]`** — two independent signals, either sufficient alone;
//! - **a stream that ends without `[DONE]` is incomplete**, never a short
//!   success.
//!
//! Both are honoured here. The philosophy is the same one the Responses machine
//! already has — an absent terminal event is an error — so only the sentinel
//! changes.
//!
//! # Usage comes from the last frame, and is derived the way the meter derives it
//!
//! `stream_options.include_usage` is forced on server-side, so the last
//! content-bearing frame is followed by a usage-only chunk. Output tokens are
//! computed as `total − prompt` rather than read from `completion_tokens`,
//! because that is what the gateway's own meter does: Anthropic reports input
//! excluding cache reads and writes, and the gateway re-adds them into
//! `prompt_tokens` and recomputes `total_tokens` itself. Trusting
//! `completion_tokens` here would put Atlas's context accounting on a different
//! footing from the number the user is billed for.
