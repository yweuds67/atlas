//! The paying organisation, on every gateway request.
//!
//! The gateway's `Atlas-Org` header names **who pays** (`docs/reference/
//! atlas-ai-api.md` §3.1). It is optional in the contract and load-bearing in
//! practice: omitted, the request is attributed to the caller *personally* —
//! and the grant that admits a request belongs to the payer, so an account
//! whose AI access comes through its organisation is refused
//! `403 no_entitlement` on every turn while its org sits fully entitled. The
//! org is never inferred server-side, because the payer is a billing decision.
//!
//! # Resolved per request, like the token
//!
//! The active organisation is app state the user can switch at any moment. A
//! header baked into provider config at connect time would bill the *old* org
//! for as long as the session lives — or start failing `403 org_not_covered`
//! after a token re-mint stops covering it. So the source is a callback, read
//! on each request, mirroring the D10 token provider's shape exactly.
//!
//! # Why a registration in a vendored crate
//!
//! The header has to be attached where the request is built, which is here;
//! the org lives in Atlas's auth state, which this crate must not depend on.
//! The same inversion `ExternalAuth` uses for the token, in miniature.
