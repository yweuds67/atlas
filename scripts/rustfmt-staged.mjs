/**
 * lint-staged's Rust formatter: `rustfmt` on the staged `.rs` files, each
 * with the edition of the crate that owns it.
 *
 * Why not `cargo fmt`: it formats whole packages, so one staged file would
 * rewrite every unstaged file around it. Why not a bare `rustfmt`: without
 * `--edition` it formats as 2015, and the workspace mixes editions — the
 * first-party crates are 2021 while the root sets 2024 for the vendored
 * engine — so the edition comes from the nearest `Cargo.toml`, exactly as
 * `cargo fmt` would pick it.
