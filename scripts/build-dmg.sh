# Atlas — local (unsigned) .dmg for ONE macOS architecture.
#
# This is the developer build behind `bun run build:app:dmg[:arm|:intel]`. For a
# shippable, signed + notarized build use `scripts/release-macos.sh`, which is
# the only path that produces something Gatekeeper accepts on another Mac.
#
# Why a script instead of the target flag inline in package.json:
#
#   - it installs the missing rustup target instead of failing deep inside
#     cargo with "can't find crate for `std`", which is what you get the first
#     time you ask for Intel on an Apple Silicon machine;
#   - it stamps the icon onto THIS build's .dmg by path. `set-dmg-icon.sh` with
#     no arguments picks the newest .dmg anywhere under target/, which silently
#     stamps the wrong file once two architectures are in play;
#   - it exports SDKROOT, which the C-building dependencies need.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/build-dmg.sh            # arm64 (default)
#   scripts/build-dmg.sh arm        # arm64
#   scripts/build-dmg.sh intel      # x86_64
# ============================================================================
