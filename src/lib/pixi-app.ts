/**
 * Ownership of the pixi `Application` instances Atlas keeps alive at once.
 *
 * Atlas runs TWO independent pixi Applications — `knowledge-graph.tsx` and
 * `memory-graph-canvas.tsx` — and both are routinely mounted together: the
 * Knowledge Graph tab is a persistent module (`display:none` when hidden, see
 * `center-panel.tsx`), so opening the Memory tab in graph mode puts a second
 * WebGL context on the page without taking the first one down.
 *
 * That is fine until one of them is destroyed. `Application.destroy(true, …)`
 * reads as "remove the canvas", and the Application-level JSDoc says exactly
 * that — but `AbstractRenderer.destroy()` ALSO treats a bare `true` as
 * `releaseGlobalResources`, and those resources are process-global, not
 * per-renderer: the pooled `Batch` objects, `TexturePool`, `CanvasPool` and the
 * canvas-texture cache are module singletons shared by every renderer on the
 * page. Releasing them destroys objects the OTHER, still-running Application is
 * mid-flight on. It does not throw at destroy time; it throws one frame later,
 * inside the survivor's own ticker:
 *
 *     TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'clear')
 *       at _DefaultBatcher.break     ← `batch.textures` was nulled by Batch.destroy()
 *       at _BatcherPipe.buildEnd
 *       at WebGLRenderer.render
 *
 * and the survivor's canvas stays blank from then on. A try/catch around
 * `destroy()` cannot see it, because the throw is on a later tick.
 *
 * So: register every Application here, destroy it through `destroyPixiApp`, and
 * the global pools are released only when the LAST one goes away — which is
 * when releasing them is both safe and the point. Destroying an app that is not
 * (or no longer) registered is a no-op, so the double-destroy the graph
 * components can produce — the unmount cleanup and the resolved `init()`
 * promise both firing — costs nothing.
