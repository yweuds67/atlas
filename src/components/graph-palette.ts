/**
 * The colours the two pixi force graphs draw with, resolved from the theme.
 *
 * `knowledge-graph.tsx` and `memory-graph-canvas.tsx` are deliberately separate
 * scene engines (see the note at the top of the memory one) — this is the one
 * thing they do share, because they are the same picture of the same kind of
 * data and a theme author would have to set two identical palettes otherwise.
 *
 * Everything here is RESOLVED (decision 14): pixi's `Graphics.fill({ color })`
 * takes a 24-bit integer and `TextStyle.fill` goes into a WebGL text atlas, so
 * neither can be handed a `var(--…)`. That is also why a graph has to repaint
 * itself on a theme switch rather than getting it for free: call
 * `graphPalette()` again from an `onThemeApplied` subscription and invalidate
 * whatever the render loop memoises on.
 *
 * Labels are kept as CSS colour strings (pixi's `TextStyle.fill` wants one)
 * while the shapes are integers, which is why each has both forms.
