// The titlebar's action dock: the loose icon row, gathered into one pill with
// a single tooltip that slides between its items.
//
// The tooltip is ONE strip containing every label, translated so the active
// label centres under the hovered icon and clipped so only that label shows.
// That is what produces the morph — the box appears to travel and resize
// between items instead of one tooltip fading out and another fading in.
//
// Animated with CSS transitions on `transform` and `clip-path`, not a spring
// library. The reference implementation uses framer-motion, which is not a
// dependency here and would be a poor one to add for this: the titlebar is on
// the eager boot path, so its cost would be paid before first paint by every
// launch, to animate a hover. Timing and curves come from
// `ui/tooltip-timing.ts`, shared with every other tooltip: the first label
// waits for the open delay, and the next one is instant while any tooltip in
// the app is warm.
//
// It opens DOWNWARD. A titlebar tooltip has nothing above it but the window
// edge and the traffic lights.

      {/* Not a child of the pill: the pill would have to clip its overflow to
          keep its round corners, and that would cut the tooltip off.

          FIXED, not absolute, and this is load-bearing. The strip is ONE row
          holding every label — `w-max`, ~414px — and it is mounted all the time,
          clipped down to the active label by `clip-path`, which is a paint
          effect and does not shrink the layout box. Anchored to the pill at the
          right end of the title bar, that box ran ~320px past the window, and
          because `#root` is `overflow: hidden` the browser treated that as
          320px of scrollable overflow it was allowed to scroll into view. Any
          programmatic reveal (`focus()`, `scrollIntoView()`) then slid the ENTIRE
          app shell left by up to 320px — nav clipped, first column of Settings
          off-screen — with no scrollbar to put it back. A fixed box is laid out
          against the viewport and is never part of an ancestor's scrollable
          overflow, so the extent it would need simply does not exist. Same
          reason `HintGroup` portals its identical strip to `body` as `fixed`.

          The price is that `top: 100%` no longer reaches the pill, so the pill's
          bottom edge is measured on hover instead (`geometry.top`). Keep both
          `left-0` and `stripLeft` reading this element's own rect: the slide
          arithmetic is relative to wherever the untranslated strip starts. */}
