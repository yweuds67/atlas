/**
 * The icon theme, as the UI consumes it.
 *
 * Rust owns the theme documents and the precedence rules. This store owns
 * three things Rust cannot: which icons are *on screen*, what has already been
 * fetched, and when to throw all of it away.
 *
 * ## Why it batches
 *
 * A file tree renders 40 virtualised rows at once and asks each one for an
 * icon. Forty `invoke()` calls per scroll tick would be forty IPC round trips
 * against a command runtime shared with the UI channel. So a row does not
 * fetch: it *registers* a want, and one flush per frame turns every want into
 * a single `resolve_icons`, then a single `get_icon_theme_assets` for whatever
 * definitions are new. A row that scrolls past before the flush costs nothing
 * beyond a map entry.
 *
 * ## Why it is lazy
 *
 * Material is 1,251 SVGs, about 1 MB. Nothing here runs at startup, and
 * nothing fetches an icon for a file the user has not looked at (decision 12).
 * The asset cache is keyed by definition id, not by path, so a project of a
 * thousand TypeScript files transfers the TypeScript icon once.
