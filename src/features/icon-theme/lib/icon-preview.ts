 * The one preview strip it carried showed the theme already applied, which is
 * the one theme you do not need to be shown. `resolve_icons` and
 * `get_icon_theme_assets` both take the theme id as an argument, so a card can
 * ask for its own icons without anything being applied — this module is that
 * call, plus the caching that keeps it to one round trip per theme.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT routed through `icon-theme-store`: that store is the ACTIVE
 * theme, keyed by path alone, and emptied wholesale on a switch. Teaching it
 * about a second theme would make every cache key in it ambiguous, for a
 * six-icon strip. This keeps its own small cache and its own font families.
