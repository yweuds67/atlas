// Bridge from the memory corpus's agent-source strings to ACP registry ids.
//
// Two id-spaces meet in the Memory tab and they are NOT the same space:
//
//   * The **registry** identifies an agent by its plugin id — "claude-acp",
//     "codex-acp", "amp-acp". `agentMeta` treats these as opaque and remaps
//     nothing; that is a deliberate invariant of the ACP registry port and is
//     locked by `agent-meta.test.ts` ("treats an agent id as opaque").
//   * The **memory corpus** tags every doc, session and shared-memory event
//     with a bare source — "claude", "codex", "atlas-agent" — written by
//     `agent_memory.rs` long before the registry existed, and still written
//     that way today. Session capture also stamped adapter-specific ids
//     ("claude-code-ts") before the port settled on `*-acp`.
//
// Handing a corpus source straight to `agentMeta` resolves nothing: "claude"
// matches no plugin id, so it fell through to a monogram or (worse, in the
// timeline) to a hardcoded Claude glyph for *every* unrecognised agent. That is
// how one agent could appear twice in one list under two different identities.
//
// The mapping lives here — at the boundary that owns the legacy spelling —
// rather than inside `agentMeta`, so the registry resolver stays opaque.
