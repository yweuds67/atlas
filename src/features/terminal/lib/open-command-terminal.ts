// Open a terminal tab that runs a command.

// Zed hands an agent's terminal-auth command to the workspace terminal
// (`SpawnInTerminal`, `use_new_terminal: true`) rather than spawning it itself,
// and that is the mechanism ported here. The reason is stdin: a login CLI that
// asks a question — a provider picker, a device-code confirmation, a y/n —
// cannot be answered by a process spawned with pipes, and Atlas spawns auth
// runs with stdin closed outright. A real PTY can be typed into.
//
// The command is QUEUED rather than exec'd: the tab is created here, its PTY is
// created later by the panel, and the terminal writes the queued line into the
// user's own interactive shell once it exists.
