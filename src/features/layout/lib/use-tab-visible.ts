 * Is this tab the one showing in its split column?

 * without a project check. The selector returns a boolean, so subscribers
 * re-render only for the two tabs involved in a switch.
 *
 * Used by panels that stay mounted while hidden and want to stop spending on
 * work nobody can see: the terminal stops rendering, the chat transcript
 * pauses its idle window fill.
