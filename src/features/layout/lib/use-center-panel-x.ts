 * The horizontal midpoint (viewport px) of the centre panel — the content area
 * between the project switcher / left sidebar and the right panel (source
 * control, team chat).
 *
 * For a docked pill or a dialog, "centred" means centred on what the user is
 * looking at, and that is the content, not the window: `fixed left-1/2` puts
 * the pill half a side panel off once one is open. Measured from the DOM
 * rather than derived from the layout store because the panels are resizable
 * and there are several of them per side; the panel's own rect is the one
 * number that is right by construction.
 *
 * `null` when there is no centre panel (projectless window) — callers fall
 * back to the viewport centre.
