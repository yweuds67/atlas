          `whitespace-nowrap` text in any panel (e.g. a 400-char commit subject

                Toggling it used to unmount the whole subtree, so every ⌘B paid to
                rebuild the file tree from scratch: re-flatten the loaded tree,
                rebuild the git status/dirty-dir maps, re-create the virtualizer,

                layout because a Panel had appeared. None of that paints
                progressively, which is why opening showed nothing and then
                everything at once.
                This is what VS Code does — `explorerView.ts` overrides
                `setVisible()` and guards work with `isBodyVisible()`, but never
                destroys the tree. Showing the panel becomes a paint.
