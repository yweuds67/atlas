 * on the left, the open Session on the right — so opening one never loses your
 * place in the list. The nav collapses while a Session is open (the header's

 *

 *
 * * **Reads are sequenced, not cancelled.** `invoke` has no abort, so every
 *   read carries a sequence number and only the newest may write state. A slow
 *   read for Project A landing after a switch to B must not overwrite B's
 *   sessions with A's.
 * * **`detail` is tri-state.** `undefined` = a read is in flight, `null` = the
 *   store answered and the Session does not exist. The first version collapsed
 *   the two and left a permanent spinner on any null result.
 * * **Everything resets on a Project switch** — open Session included. The
 *   old Session id means nothing in the new store.
 * * **Refresh is event-driven first** (`atlas:git-changed`, which the watcher
 *   emits on every repo move), with a 15 s poll as the fallback for capture
 *   writes that produce no git event — and the poll only runs while the tab is
