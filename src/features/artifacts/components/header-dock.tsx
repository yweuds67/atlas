/**
 * The Timeline header's action dock.
 *
 * One pill holding every icon control, in the shape the titlebar dock uses
 * (`components/titlebar-dock.tsx`): a hairline round-ended track, icons as
 * round hover targets inside it, no dividers between them. The controls used to
 * be two bordered segments and a loose button, which drew three boxes in a 32px
 * bar to say one thing — "here are the tab's actions".
 *
 * The controls share one sliding tooltip (`HintGroup`), as the titlebar dock's
 * do: the dock is the group, and each control is a `HintItem` — `DockButton`
 * wraps itself, and the Radix triggers wrap their `Trigger` in one.
 *
 * Its own module rather than living in the panel, because the checkpoints picker
 * needs the trigger class too — and importing it from the panel, which imports
 * the picker, is a cycle that happens to work until someone moves a top-level
 * constant.

/**
 * The pill that gathers the header's icon controls.
 *
 * **The geometry is concentric, and it has to stay that way.** Round inside
 * round only looks right when the inner radius equals the outer radius minus
 * the padding, and the padding is the same on all four sides: 28px tall, 4px of
 * inset, 20px buttons — so 14 − 4 = 10, the button's own radius. The first pass
 * used 22px buttons with 6px of side padding, which left them tangent to the
 * pill's end caps: a hovered button's fill ran into the border at the ends and
 * the two curves visibly disagreed.
