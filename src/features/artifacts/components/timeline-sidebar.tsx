/**
 * The Timeline's left nav — the session list drawn as a commit graph.
 *
 * This is deliberately the *same* renderer idea as the Git commit graph
 * (`features/git/components/commit-node.tsx`), down to the path maths: lanes at
 * fixed x, one `<svg>` per row, every segment terminating at `y = 0`,
 * a row's dot or its full height so adjacent rows butt together seamlessly, and a lane
 * change drawn as a cubic whose two control points sit on the segment's
 * vertical midpoint. Three hand-rolled curve attempts went by before this;
 * the graph had already solved it, and a sidebar that draws its thread exactly
 * like the commit graph is one idiom in the app instead of two.
 *
 * Lanes here are hierarchy rather than branches:
 *
 * * **0** — a day.
 * * **1** — a session (or a folded cluster) inside that day.
 * * **2** — the sessions inside an expanded cluster.
 *
 * Rows are a flat array so the list can be virtualized, which is the other half
 * of what the graph panel does: fixed row heights, `overscan`, a stable
 * `getItemKey`, memoized rows, absolute `translateY` positioning. A board can
 * hold 500 sessions and the nav stays a few dozen mounted rows.

/**
 * A title that dissolves at its right edge instead of ending in an ellipsis.
 *
 * The fade is on the **text**, not on the row. An overlay across the whole row
 * — which is what this replaced — washes out whatever else shares the line, and
 * the byline sitting at that edge came out grey on every row.
 *
 * ## Why this needs no measurement, despite appearances
 *
 * The obvious objection is that an unconditional mask would fade the last 32px
 * of *every* title, including short ones that fit — and this component did
 * measure, for exactly that reason. The reasoning was wrong.
 *
 * The span is `w-full`, so the mask is laid over a **full-width box**, and its
 * fade region sits at the right edge of that box rather than at the end of the
 * text. A short title stops well before it and is never touched. Only text that
 * actually reaches the last 32px is faded — which is the behaviour the
 * measurement was trying to buy.
 *
 * ## Why measuring was not merely redundant but harmful
 *
 * It read `scrollWidth` from a `useLayoutEffect`, so every row scrolling into
 * view forced a synchronous reflow and then a `setState` *before paint*,
 * costing a second render and a second layout — per row, several rows per
 * frame. That is what took the nav off 60fps. `Clamp` in `session-detail.tsx`
 * is the pattern to follow if a measurement is ever genuinely needed here:
 * plain `useEffect`, read inside the observer callback, never on the mount path.
 *
 * ## The one case given up
 *
 * A title that *ends* within the last 32px fades its final characters even
 * though it fits. It reads as a word running to the edge, and it is rare — most
 * titles are either clearly short or clearly long. Narrow `TITLE_FADE_PX` if it
 * ever grates; do not bring back the measurement.
