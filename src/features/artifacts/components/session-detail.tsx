 * timeline as a **thin rail in the gutter** — a hairline with a small node per
 * entry — so the shape of a turn is scannable without reading a word, and the
 * prose keeps the full width of the column. The previous version boxed every
 * entry, which made a long Session a stack of cards and buried the one thing
 * that matters: the sequence.
 *
 * Only two things get a card: a **code/data block** (mono, needs its own
 * boundary) and a **Checkpoint** (a commit is a boundary in the Session, not
 * another row in it). Everything else is prose on the page.
 *
 * Long Sessions are windowed: the first 300 visible entries render, and more are
 * appended as the scroll approaches the bottom. Deliberately slice-based rather
 * than a virtualizer — entries expand and collapse, so measured-height
 * virtualization would fight the content, and a Session being *read* is scrolled
 * forward, not randomly accessed. Jumping to a Checkpoint extends the window
 * first.
 *
 * Everything shown is already redacted. Scrubbing happened before persistence,
 * so there is no way for this component to leak something the store does not
 * already hold.

 * contain, so a needle cannot falsely match across a field boundary. Payloads
 * are searched too — a stack trace is exactly the thing someone comes back to
 * a Session to find — but a truncated entry can only match on its preview,
