/**
 * The inline comment thread — a Figma-style popover hung off a timeline node.
 *
 * Inline rather than a side panel, because a comment is *about one row* and a
 * panel makes you hold the anchor in your head while you read it. The thread
 * opens beside the thing it is discussing and closes again.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * A root, its replies indented under a rail, and one composer per thread.
 * **Exactly two levels** — that is the server's rule, not a simplification: it
 * refuses to re-parent a reply, so a deeper tree could never be sent. The UI
 * says so by giving a reply no reply button of its own.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * **Offline drafting.** Comments are network-only; there is no local table and
 * nothing queues. The composer keeps your text on failure rather than pretending
 * it sent.
 *
 * **Reactions.** The server has no reactions model on this surface — no table,
 * no route — so the thumbs-up in the reference design has nothing behind it.
 * Resolve and Reply are the two actions that exist.
