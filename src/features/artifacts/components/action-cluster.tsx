/**
 * One surround for a row's controls.
 *
 * Grouping the comment button and the copy button in one pill is what stops a
 * discussed row from showing a pill with a gap beside it, waiting for something
 * to appear: if any control in the group is pinned, the whole group is.
 *
 * Renders nothing when it has no children, so a row with nothing to offer
 * carries no empty pill.
 *
 * `reveal` is how the hidden state comes back. The Timeline fades; the chat
 * transcript SNAPS, because a running opacity transition is a compositing
 * layer in WebKit and rows passing under a resting pointer mid-fling each
 * took one (see the note in `chat/components/user-row-actions.tsx`).
