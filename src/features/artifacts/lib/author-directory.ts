/**
 * Who a Session belongs to, resolved once for the whole board.
 *
 * A board row carries an `authorId` and nothing else — the server stamps it
 * from the verified token and never sends a name, because the roster is a
 * different read with different permissions. Turning that id into a face and a
 * first name means a lookup, and doing it *inside* a row would put a store
 * subscription on all five hundred of them.
 *
 * So the lookup is built once, above the list, and passed down as one stable
 * object. Rows stay `memo`-able because the reference only changes when the
 * roster actually does.
 *
 * # Where the roster comes from
 *
 * `members-store`, keyed by the **server** org id — the same list the members
 * modal shows, and the only one that is populated whether or not team chat has
 * connected. Its `avatarPath` is a photo Rust already cached to disk, so a
 * board of five hundred rows costs no requests to Google or GitHub.
