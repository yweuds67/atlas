/**
 * One open Session's comments, kept current.
 *
 * Loads once when a shared Session opens, then follows the realtime channel.
 * Returns `null` for a Session that is not on the server, which is what hides
 * every comment affordance — there is no anchor to attach one to.
 *
 * # Why the socket and not a poll
 *
 * The server sends **one** frame shape for post, edit, resolve and delete, so a
 * single handler covers all four and the thread stays right without refetching.
 * A poll would also have to re-read the whole list every time: the comments
 * endpoint is unpaged.
 *
 * # No optimism, on purpose
 *
 * A posted comment appears when the server has it, because the server is what
 * stamps the author, parses the mentions, and can refuse. Painting one
 * optimistically — with no offline queue to hold it — would be a lie that loses
 * the text the moment the request failed.
