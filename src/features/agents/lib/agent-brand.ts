 * `agent.gpt.*`, `agent.gemini.*`, `agent.amp.*` and so on — and eight of them
 * named agents that do not exist in Atlas, while three more were overridden by
 * hardcoded CSS before they ever rendered. Two things make the whole family
 * wrong as a theme surface:
 *
 *  - **ADR-0002.** No agent gets special treatment. A theme file that can name
 *    Claude and Cursor but not the agent you installed this morning is a list
 *    of favourites.
 *  - **The set is discovered at runtime.** An author cannot enumerate what they
 *    are theming, so the keys could never be complete.
 *
 * What is left is `agent.chip.foreground` / `agent.chip.background`: one
 * neutral pair the chip falls back to, which is what lets a monochrome theme
 * (Atlas Mono, Vesper) flatten every identity to its own palette. These
 * constants are the vendors' marks — a third party's colour, not Atlas's, and
 * not something a theme should be able to restate.
