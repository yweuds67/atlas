// The one sign-in surface for every ACP agent (Phase M of
// `plans/atlas-acp-auth-login-loop.md`).
//
// Replaces three copy-pasted dialogs — `AgentLoginDialog` (cursor/opencode/
// kilo), `CodexLoginDialog`, and `ClaudeLoginDialog` — which had drifted into
// three different phase machines and three different renderings of the same
// idea. There is now one component, one `Phase` union, and one host; agents
// differ only in the auth methods they advertise and an optional
// `onAuthenticated` hook.
//
// Every visual here is lifted from `agent-login-dialog.tsx`, which is the
// styling reference: same Radix Dialog geometry, same header band, same
// method-row button, same type scale, same tokens. No new
// visual patterns — see the design-language rule in the plan.
//
// One method type per branch, mirroring ACP:
//   `agent`    → call `authenticate(methodId)` and let the CLI drive itself.
//   `terminal` → open the login CLI in a REAL terminal and let the user drive
//                it, with a dock offering "I've finished signing in" → a
//                best-effort `authenticate()`, then the rebind that actually
//                checks the login. Atlas no longer runs these headlessly
//                first: piped stdio cannot answer a login that asks a
//                question, so that path could only ever hang (#24).
//   `env_var`  → a read-only checklist of variables the user must export. There
//                is deliberately NO key input: for ACP agents, credentials live
//                in the system environment (the plan's BYOK-maps-to-env
//                contract), and Atlas holds no agent tokens.
