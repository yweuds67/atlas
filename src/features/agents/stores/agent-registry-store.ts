// Hydrated at startup and on every `atlas:agent-catalog:changed`; `agentMeta()`
// (lib/agent-meta) is the read surface every UI consumer goes through.
//
// Two answers, one authority: the `catalog` says which agents exist and how
// each would launch; `registryEntries` is the Marketplace's browse list (every
// published agent, installed or not) and nothing else reads it. The old
// `plugins` list was a third answer to the same question and is gone.
//
// Selector discipline: Record-of-objects selectors infinite-loop under
// useShallow (known Atlas trap) — components subscribe to the primitive
// `signature` string and read the arrays via `getState()`.
