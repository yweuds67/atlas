/**
 * Sign-in episodes — pure state in / state out. An agent that needs sign-in
 * tends to say so again and again (every retried turn, every thread bound to
 * it); one notification covers the lot until the user has signed in.
 *
 * An episode is open from the first auth-required signal until the agent is
 * known to work again (the sign-in dialog finished, or one of its turns
 * completed). The episode number is part of the dedupe key, so delivery
 * announces each episode once, and the next time the agent signs out is a new
 * episode and speaks again. Same shape for Atlas's own session.
