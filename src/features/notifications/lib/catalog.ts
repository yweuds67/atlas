/**
 * The notification catalog — every kind Atlas can raise, and how it behaves
 * by default. The pipeline is catalog → `decideNotification` (pure: event,
 * environment, prefs → channels + content) → `deliverNotification` (the one
 * place with side effects).
 *
 * Each entry names:
 *  - its urgency `tier` — `needs-you` (blocked on the user), `outcome` (work
 *    finished or failed), `warning` (something degraded), `team` (Chat);
 *  - the `channels` it may use (each still gated by environment and prefs);
 *  - its `sound` (a system sound for the OS banner; the in-app chime when the
 *    banner is not shown);
 *  - its `groupKey` (what collapses together — one terminal, one session);
 *  - whether it is `locked` (cannot be silenced). Every other kind gets its
 *    own switch in Settings, stored in `notifyDisabledKinds`.
 *
 * Pure — no store, Tauri or DOM imports.
