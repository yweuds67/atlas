// Chat-message renderer: the lazy boundary, the member directory, and nothing
// else. The pipeline itself is `./message-body-impl`.
//
// This used to be a hand-written parser, on the stated grounds that mentions
// have to resolve against the member directory at render time and that feeding
// `<@u_id>` through a sanitizing markdown pass would yield "either an escaped
// literal or a stripped span". That is true of a markdown→HTML→sanitize
// pipeline. It is NOT true of a remark plugin working on the syntax tree: the
// token never becomes HTML, it becomes an mdast node that react-markdown hands
// to a React component, which reads the directory through context on every
// render. See `../lib/remark-comms-inline` for why a mention inside code is
// safer under this design than it was under the old regex ordering.
//
// What survives from that reasoning: this is deliberately NOT the agent chat's
// `CachedMarkdown`. That pipeline caches HTML strings in a process-wide LRU
// keyed by source text — which would bake a member's name, or a momentarily
// empty roster's `@unknown`, into a cache entry that outlives the rename. A
// chat message is also settled the moment it lands, so the worker, the
// priority queue and the streaming tail lane have nothing to do here.
//
// The highlight.js stylesheet is imported HERE, on the eager side, for the same
// reason `src/lib/markdown.tsx` does it: it is small, and keeping it out of the
// lazy chunk means a code fence never paints unstyled for a frame.
