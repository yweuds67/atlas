/**
 * The end of the import path.
 *
 * `crates/atlas-theme/tests/import.rs` proves the converted TOML parses and
 * carries every required base token, but "parses" is not the bar an imported
 * theme has to clear — the bar is that the TypeScript resolver produces EVERY
 * theme key in the registry from it, with a real colour in each. The count is
 * `THEME_KEY_REGISTRY.length` and moves with `keys.toml`; do not restate it. Those are two different
 * checks separated by a language boundary, and only one of them can be run in
 * Rust.
 *
 * So the Rust suite writes `imported-themes.json` (a snapshot it also asserts
 * is current) and this suite resolves it, exactly as the app would. A mapping
 * change in Rust that leaves a key resolving to an empty string fails here.
 *
 * The fixtures behind the snapshot: a tweakcn Catppuccin registry item, both
 * members of a Zed family, and a VS Code theme with an `include`.
