/**
 * Session capture setup and status, opened from the titlebar project pill.
 *
 * The load-bearing decision is that **Local is a real mode, not a waiting room
 * for Cloud**: one click, no account, no network, and it produces the complete
 * product. Cloud and Connect sit one level deeper as tabs, disabled with a
 * stated reason when unavailable — the requirement is obvious before the form
 * is filled in rather than after.
 *
 * Two flows end in a **disclosure step with real numbers** (Cloud create's
 * history import, and Local→Cloud promotion), because each is one of the only
 * bulk-disclosure moments in the feature. Both are steps *inside* the popover
 * rather than modal dialogs, and both invoke nothing until Confirm — closing
 * the popover mid-flow is a true cancel because there is nothing to undo.
 *
 * Ordering inside the Cloud confirm matters and is not obvious:
 * `capture_register_cloud` requires an existing binding, so Confirm runs
 * enable-Local → register → import-confirm. Running enable *before* the
 * disclosure would leave a bound Project behind a Cancel, which is exactly
 * what "Cancel = nothing happens" forbids.
 *
 * **Cloud follows the active Organisation, and only that one.** Capture is
 * per-project and a project belongs to the Organisation you are working in, so
 * offering a picker over every linked Organisation invites binding a repository
 * into a tenant you are not looking at — and the mistake is only visible later,
 * in a shared timeline. The Organisation row below is therefore a label, not a
 * choice.
 */

/**
 * Cloud capture was gated off here for as long as the ingest service answered
 * 405 to every GET, which made Connect unable to list and the Slug check unable
 * to answer. Those read routes are deployed now, so the gate is gone and the
 * only remaining reasons are the ones the developer can act on — see
 * `cloudReason`.
 *
 * Local capture is unaffected either way: it never touches the network, which is
 * the whole point of it being a real mode rather than a waiting room.

 * Why capture is degraded or stopped, and one click to try to fix it.

 * people to stop reading the thing they are supposed to notice.
 *
 * **One line per issue.** It used to stack the reason over its `nextStep` as two
 * paragraphs, which turned a two-issue banner into four lines of red prose that
 * nobody finished reading. The reason is the line; the `nextStep` moves to the
 * title, so it is still reachable and no longer competing.
 *
 * **The banner is the retry.** Clicking it re-runs `capture_retry_watcher`,
 * which restarts the git watcher and answers with the health that *results* —
 * so the banner either clears or keeps saying what is still wrong, rather than
 * clearing optimistically and returning on the next poll. The retry is offered
 * for any unhealthy state rather than only the watcher issue: `HealthIssue`
 * carries prose, not a machine-readable code, and string-matching a sentence to
 * decide whether a button appears is the kind of thing that breaks silently the
 * next time the wording changes. Re-running health is harmless when the problem
 * was something else — it just tells the truth again.
