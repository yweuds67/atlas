/**
 * The Timeline entry point: one row in the Project switcher panel.
 *
 * Deliberately inert. It used to carry a capture-state dot and a
 * stopped/review warning, which meant polling `capture_binding` and
 * `capture_health` every 15 seconds — two fresh read-only store connections per
 * tick — for a row whose only job is navigation.
 *
 * That indicator was also answering the wrong question. The Timeline board is
 * **Organisation-scoped**: it spans every project in the active org. A dot
 * describing the *currently open project's* capture state is a fact about
 * somewhere else, sitting next to a link that does not go there. Capture state
 * belongs where capture is configured — the titlebar pill and the Timeline
 * tab's own header — both of which already show it, and neither of which had to
 * poll to find out.
 *
 * The row is no longer gated on having a project open either, for the same
 * reason: an org-wide destination should not disappear because no folder
 * happens to be focused.
