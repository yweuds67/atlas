/**
 * The recording dot: a small green pulse while capture is live.
 *
 * Green and *moving* is the whole signal — a static coloured dot in a titlebar
 * reads as a status LED nobody looks at twice, and the point of this one is to
 * be noticed once and then ignored. The pulse is a second ring behind the dot
 * rather than an opacity animation on the dot itself, so the core stays at full
 * strength and only the halo breathes; a fading dot looks like a rendering bug.
 *
 * The wrapper is a fixed-size grid cell, which is what keeps it on the text
 * baseline's centre line: sizing the ring off the dot made the flex line box
 * taller than the dot and pushed it visibly off-centre.
