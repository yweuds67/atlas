// Wire types + render constants for the git-graph panel.

// The graph LAYOUT algorithm lives in Rust:
// `src-tauri/src/commands/git_graph.rs::git_graph_build` runs `git log`
// + `git for-each-ref` in parallel, lays out lanes/segments, and ships
// a `BuiltGraph` ready to render. The frontend used to do all of this
// in `buildGraph(...)` (~300 LOC walking commits + allocating lanes
// per-row) on every git signature change — that's pure business logic
// per the "Rust owns logic" rule.
//
// These interfaces are the wire-shape projection of the Rust types
// (see git_graph.rs). Keep them in sync field-for-field.
