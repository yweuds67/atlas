/**
 * Pinned user messages in an agent chat — the comms pin rail, applied to the
 * agent thread. A pin is a bookmark the reader can jump back to from the
 * header dropdown; it changes nothing about the conversation itself.
 *
 * # Why the renderer owns this
 *
 * Everywhere else the house rule is that Rust owns state. A pin is the
 * exception on purpose: it is a view bookmark, not conversation data. The
 * agent never sees it, no other surface reads it, and losing one costs the
 * reader a scroll. That is `persist` to localStorage, the same trade the
 * recent-chats rail already makes — not a store file, a command and a
 * migration. (Comms pins go to the server because they are shared with other
 * humans; these are not.)
 *
 * # Scope
 *
 * Keyed by ACP session id where the session has bound, and by tab id before
 * it has (see `pinScope`). The session id is what survives a relaunch, so a
 * pin placed on a bound session is still there when the thread is resumed;
 * one placed in the first seconds of a brand-new chat is tab-scoped and does
 * not survive, which is the right way round — nothing is pinned that early.
 *
 * The pinned TEXT rides with the pin. A pin can address a message far outside
 * the loaded window (or one the transcript has not projected yet), and the
 * dropdown has to render a preview either way — the same reason the comms
 * rail carries each message with its pin rather than reading the store.

 * The id is tried first but cannot be relied on: `replaceMessages` re-mints
 * every id as `msg-<now>-<i>` on each history load, resume and snapshot
 * backfill, so a pin can point at an id no message carries. The fallback is
 * the text the bubble SHOWS — `userMessageText`, the same derivation the pin
 * recorded — compared for equality. Not the wire content: a prompt arrives
 * with memory blocks injected AHEAD of it and a directive after, so neither
 * equality nor a prefix against `m.content` ever matched.
 *
 * Timestamp breaks ties between identical prompts where it survived; text
 * alone is the last resort for a timestamp the paint path invented
 * (`m.timestamp ?? now`). Matched within the pin's own side of the exchange —
 * the same prose in a reply must not hijack a prompt's jump, or vice versa.
