/**
 * The native agent's no-grant setup state (spec D15a, acceptance bar item 14).
 *
 * A signed-in user whose organisation has no AI grant is not having a failure,
 * they are having a **setup problem** — the gateway's own words. Shown as an
 * error it reads as something broken, and they go hunting for a switch to flip.
 * There is no such switch; an admin has to grant it, so the bar says that and
 * offers the two things the user *can* do: re-check, or ask to be counted.
 *
 * The composer below it is disabled while this shows (see `message-input.tsx`),
 * so this bar is the explanation for a dead input — which is why the strip is
 * attached to the composer rather than floating somewhere near it, and why
 * dismissing it does not re-enable anything.
 *
 * It was a centred floating pill until 2026-08-31. Two problems with that: it
 * shared the `z-20` floating row with "Scroll to bottom" (they overlapped when
 * both showed), and it rendered the gateway's raw sentence — which names the
 * organisation by *id*, a 26-character opaque string the user has never seen.
 * The org NAME is right there in the auth snapshot.
