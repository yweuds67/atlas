// The transcript: a windowed list of real DOM rows.
//
// **Not virtualized, on purpose.** A virtualizer was tried here first and lost
// to the Session timeline on the only test that matters — scrolling it — despite
// the timeline rendering far heavier rows. Two reasons, both measured rather
// than reasoned:
//
//  1. **Blanking.** Unmounting offscreen rows means a fast flick outruns React's
//     ability to mount the ones arriving, and the reader watches empty space.
//     Raising overscan only moves the speed at which it happens. A row that is
//     already in the DOM cannot blank.
//  2. **Scroll cost.** A virtualizer has to know where everything is on every
//     scroll. The windowed approach asks nothing on scroll: the browser scrolls
//     a plain document, which is the operation it is most optimized for.
//
// So this mirrors `session-detail.tsx`: render a window of real rows and grow it
// as the reader approaches its edge, with `use-transcript-scroll.ts` keeping the
// scroll loop free of forced layout.
//
// The window grows UPWARD (chat is read newest-first), which the timeline never
// has to handle — see the re-anchoring in `useLayoutEffect` below.
//
// Because rows are real DOM, nothing here predicts heights. The whole
// predicted-height apparatus the virtualized version needed — a height
// function, canvas text measurement, a dev drift assertion — is gone.
