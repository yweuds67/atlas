/**
 * The comment affordances inside a turn's fold, when its session is shared.
 * (Prompts and responses carry theirs in their action bars — see
 * `user-row-actions.tsx` and `prose-row-actions.tsx`.)
 *
 * Every component here reads `chat-comments-store` through a narrow selector
 * and renders NOTHING when the tab has no cloud target or the row was never
 * captured — so an unshared chat pays no DOM for any of this. The thread
 * popover, faces and composer are the Timeline's `CommentButton`, unchanged.
 *
 * Nothing here transitions. The transcript's hover reveals snap (see
 * `user-row-actions.tsx`); `transition-none` overrides the button's own.
