/**
 * The "you could also have these" half of the composer's agent picker: a short,
 * marketed list of popular agents the user has not installed, each a one-click
 * install that switches the chat to it when it lands.
 *
 * Renders NOTHING once the user has them all — the divider goes with it, so a
 * fully-stocked picker is exactly the list of agents you can switch to.
 *
 * Installing writes the same installed-map entry the Marketplace writes (there
 * is no second install path); the binary, if any, is fetched by the first
 * connect. So "installed" here means "switchable now", which is why switching
 * to it immediately afterwards is safe.
