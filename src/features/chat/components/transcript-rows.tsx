// Row components for the new transcript.
//
// House rules, all of which exist to keep the thread quiet and cheap to scroll:
//
//  1. No element grows on hover or on load. Anything expandable either toggles
//     via row state (which reflows once, deliberately) or opens the detail
//     panel. Diffs and tool output are the panel's job, never the thread's —
//     that is what keeps a turn's cost bounded no matter what the agent did.
//  2. The only things with colour are diff counts, the running-state glyph, and
//     the turn footer's primary action. Everything else is foreground/muted
//     grey. Per-tool icon SHAPES are fine and are what the marker rows use —
//     per-tool icon COLOURS are the "moving blocks" problem in a new costume,
//     and are the thing to resist.
//  3. Rows never subscribe to the chat store or the detail-panel store. Data
//     arrives as props; actions are fired imperatively via `getState()`.

 * state instead, and earns it by saying three things the settled sentence
 * cannot: what is running right now, how many actions are already behind it,
 * and how long the current one has been going. Auto-expanding was the
 * alternative and was rejected — it makes the transcript reflow under the
 * reader mid-turn, for detail that is one click away and that the folded
 * summary reports a second later anyway.
 *
 * The numeric gutter is the same right-hand slot `MarkerRowView` puts `+n −m`
 * in, for the same reason: the left of a marker line is a sentence, the right
 * is a column of figures, and they should not interleave.
 *
 * The chevron appears on hover and stays visible when open.
