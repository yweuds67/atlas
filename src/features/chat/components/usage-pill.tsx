/**
 * The Usage pill — the one place a session's consumption is shown, for
 * every agent.
 *
 * Sits first in the composer footer's right cluster (`[Usage] [Options]
 * [Plan]`) as its own right-anchored dropup. The pill itself reads the most
 * useful single number it has: the context window's fill as a percentage
 * with a ring (any agent that reports a gauge), else total tokens (an agent
 * that reports a split but no window), else just "Usage". While the agent
 * compacts its context the pill says so, which is what the native agent's
 * old tok/cost pill used to do.
 *
 * It replaces the status-bar usage widget and the native agent's composer
 * pill, both of which rendered the persisted input/output split and read as
 * "0 tokens · $0.0000" for every ACP session — the protocol never sends
 * that split mid-turn, and the end-of-turn one was dropped before it got
 * here. See `use-session-usage.ts` for what feeds this now.
