/**
 * LOADING STATE — the pixel-grid loader shown while a turn is doing work the
 * transcript can't render yet (the ACP round-trip, the first tokens, the beat
 * before a tool call).
 *
 * Three parts, in order: a 3×3 grid of dots lit by a travelling wavefront, a
 * shimmering label, and a live elapsed timer in mono tabular figures.
 *
 * Default variant is `dots` — the round cells. `drive` is the same wavefront
 * with square cells, `orbit` a comet lapping the perimeter.
 *
 * Perf notes — this sits INSIDE the transcript, above a long thread of real
 * DOM rows:
 *  - the grid animates `opacity` only (paint, no layout, no transform), on
 *    nine 2.5px cells, so it can't touch the scroll path;
 *  - the timer writes `textContent` through a ref on a 100ms interval. A
 *    `useState` tick would re-render this component 10×/s while the transcript
 *    is also draining stream deltas; the DOM write costs nothing and React
 *    never hears about it;
 *  - the row is a fixed height, so its mount/unmount doesn't jolt the thread.
 *
 * Reduced motion freezes the grid to its dim state; the timer still ticks.
