/**
 * The strip tucked into the top of the chat composer — one construction for
 * every notice that explains the composer's state (no AI grant, agent
 * removed…), so they all read as part of the composer rather than as a stray
 * banner floating above it.
 *
 * Same construction as the artifacts composer's checkpoint scope picker:
 * inset by `mx-2` so the composer's box reads as the wider element,
 * `rounded-t-2xl` to match the agent composer's rounding, and `-mb-3.5`
 * against `pb-5` so the composer overlaps its lower half. `z-0` keeps it
 * behind — the composer carries `relative z-30`.
