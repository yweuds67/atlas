/**
 * The transcript's scroll loop. A direct port of the Session timeline's
 * `use-timeline-scroll.ts` discipline, inverted for chat.
 *
 * The rule that makes it fast, and the reason the timeline outruns a virtualized
 * list despite rendering far more complex rows:
 *
 *   **Nothing reads layout in the scroll handler.** It schedules a frame and
 *   returns. Inside the frame the only property read is `scrollTop`, which is
 *   the one piece of scroll geometry that does not force a synchronous layout.
 *   Content height and viewport height are cached and re-measured only when a
 *   `ResizeObserver` says they actually changed — which is exactly when they can
 *   go stale (the window grew, an accordion opened) and never merely because
 *   someone scrolled.
 *
 * State is published only on *change*, so a flick that stays within one state
 * re-renders nothing at all.
 *
 * ── What differs from the timeline ──
 *
 * The timeline reads FORWARD: it renders `slice(0, n)` and grows at the bottom,
 * where new rows appear below the fold and disturb nothing. A chat is read
 * BACKWARD — it opens at the newest turn and scrolls up into history — so this
 * window grows at the TOP. Prepending rows moves everything below them, so the
 * caller must re-anchor after a grow; `growAnchor` hands it the invariant to
 * restore (distance from the bottom, which prepending leaves untouched).
