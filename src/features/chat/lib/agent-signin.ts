// way to act on it — their CLI lives in Atlas's app-data dir, not on PATH, so
// "run `cursor-agent login`" was advice the user could not follow.

// The flow mirrors what the adapters ask for: run the CLI's own login (opens
// the browser, streamed through `atlas:auth-run:*`), then call ACP
// `authenticate()` on the live agent so the already-running session picks the
// new credentials up without a respawn.
