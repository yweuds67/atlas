//     `run ×6, tool ×1, read ×1, search ×1` summarised as exactly three
//     fragments with no "searched" among them — so a search counts toward
//     "read files". The plural confirms it: that turn read ONE file by glyph
//     yet said "read files", which only adds up if the search counted too.
//  2. The order is fixed, not by frequency and not by when things happened.
//     That same turn led with "Loaded a tool" off a single call while its six
//     commands came last, and its first row chronologically was a command.
//  3. The glyph is the first bucket in the sentence, again not the commonest —
//     the wrench above six terminal rows, and a book on "Read files, ran
//     commands".
//
// Where the fragment for a bucket is unobserved (`edit`), or where a glyph has
