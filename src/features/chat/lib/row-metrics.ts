// with it went the height function, the canvas text measurement, and the dev
// drift assertion. Rows are real DOM now and the browser owns their size.
//
// What is left is the handful of numbers the components genuinely share with the
// stylesheet — currently just the user-bubble clamp, which has to agree with the
// `max-height` budget `useWholeLineClamp` (in `transcript-rows.tsx`) snaps to
// whole lines and with the "is this long enough to need a Show more" test.
