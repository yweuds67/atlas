/**
 * The Usage tab's series palette, from the active theme.
 *
 * Every colour here is handed to a `style` prop as a VALUE — the glyph chart's
 * stacked segments, the inline bars in the top list and the tables — so none
 * of it can be a `var(--…)` and all of it is resolved (decision 14).
 *
 * The palette is the theme's `chart-1..5`, which is exactly what those five
 * shadcn base tokens are for: a theme author picks five colours that read as a
 * set against their own background, and every chart in Atlas follows. This
 * file used to hold ten hand-picked greys chosen for one AMOLED-black theme;
 * on Rosé Pine Dawn they were invisible.
 *
 * Five tokens, more series than that: `seriesColor` cycles them and pulls each
 * further lap toward the background or the foreground — alternating which,
 * lap over lap — so an eleventh project is still separable without inventing
 * an eleventh token (decision 18 — role tokens only). Alternating the target
 * instead of just deepening the same fade means two laps can share a fade
 * *amount* without sharing a resolved colour, so the cycle doesn't visibly
 * repeat until far past any table Atlas renders.
 *
 * Read it through `useSeriesPalette()`. The hook subscribes to
 * `atlas:theme-applied`, so a chart repaints on a theme switch; the
 * module-level constants this replaced could not.

/**
 * The colours a model or agent chip wears in the tables, keyed by the family
 * it belongs to.
 *
 * A grey chip per row told you a model existed and nothing else; with a tint
 * you can see at a glance that a window was mostly Claude, or that one project
 * is the only thing still on a local model. Families, not individual models —
 * a colour per model id would be a new hue every release.
 *
 * The hue is the vendor's own, from `agents/lib/agent-brand.ts`, so the chip
 * carries the colour that vendor already has everywhere else in the app rather
 * than a fourth palette invented for this table. It is deliberately NOT a theme
 * key: a theme that could restate Anthropic's terracotta would be a theme lying
 * about someone else's brand (the 2026-09-18 audit that cut the eighteen
 * `agent.*` keys to two). The fill is the same hue at a tenth, which is what
 * the old `--agent-*-chip-bg` pairs were.
 *
 * The fallback, for a model nobody recognises, is the one pair that IS
 * themeable: `agent.chip.background` — the app's own "identity chip with no
 * identity" fill, and what `.amark` draws — under `muted-foreground`. Quiet on
 * purpose, so an unrecognised model does not end up the loudest thing in the
 * table.
