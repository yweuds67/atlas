// Account state, mirrored from Rust.
//
// This store is a pure reflection of `atlas:auth-changed`. It never decides
// anything: Rust owns the credential, the grant, and every transition, so the
// only writer here is the event handler wired up once in App.tsx.
//
// `dialogOpen` is the one piece of genuinely local state — whether the connect
// dialog is on screen. It is separate from `status` because a user can dismiss
// the dialog while a grant is still valid, and reopening it must resume rather
// than restart.

 * Keep the renderer's crash-reporting identity in step with the account.

 * Rust does the same for product events off its own auth funnel; posthog-js
 * holds a separate distinct id in localStorage, so it has to be told here. Done
 * inside `setSnapshot` because that is the store's single write path — every
 * transition, including the launch restore, passes through it exactly once.
 *
 * `connecting`, and `signed-in` before the profile lands, are deliberately left
 * alone: the next snapshot carries the user, and resetting in that gap would
 * bounce attribution back to the device for no reason.
