/**
 * On-disk shape of `~/.config/atlas/keybindings.json`, mirrored by
 * `src-tauri/src/commands/keybindings.rs`. Rust validates the shape and owns
 * the file; the renderer resolves and dispatches (keydown is inherently a
 * renderer concern).
 *
 * A profile stores OVERRIDES only: a key present with a string[] replaces the
 * action's default combos, `null` unbinds it, and an absent key means "use
 * the default". New actions shipped in a later build therefore flow into
 * every existing profile without a migration.
 *
 * `basedOn` names a preset (`presets.ts`) layered between the defaults and
 * the overrides, so "the default" for an absent key is the preset's chord
 * when it has one. An id this build doesn't know is kept on disk and ignored.
