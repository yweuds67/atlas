/**
 * Chords the operating system takes before Atlas ever sees them.

 * Binding one is allowed — Atlas can't stop the user, and on a machine with
 * the system shortcut turned off it even works — so this is a warning shown
 * while recording, not a rejection. The list is deliberately short: only
 * chords the OS itself owns, where the binding would appear to do nothing.
 * ⌘W and friends are Atlas's to bind; the webview hands them over.
