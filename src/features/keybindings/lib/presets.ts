/**
 * Keymap presets — "I'm coming from VS Code" as a data table.
 *
 * A preset is a sparse layer between the registry defaults and a profile's
 * own overrides (`defaults → preset → overrides`, see `resolve.ts`). It names
 * only the commands where the other editor has a well-known equivalent;
 * everything else keeps Atlas's chord, so a command added in a later build
 * gets a working default under every preset the day it lands.
 *
 * Each table follows that editor's macOS default keymap, checked against its
 * shipped keymap file or docs. `cmd` is the primary modifier (Ctrl off
 * macOS), so the same table is right on Windows and Linux to the extent
 * those editors swap ⌘ for Ctrl there. Every preset must resolve without a
 * hard conflict on both platforms — `presets.test.ts` holds that line.
 *
 * Multi-stroke chords (VS Code's `⌘K Z` zen mode, `⌘K ⌘S` keybindings) are
 * absent: Atlas matches single chords, so an entry for one would be a
 * binding that silently never fires. JetBrains' double-⇧ Search Everywhere is
 * absent for the same reason.
 *
 * The ids are STORAGE KEYS — a profile's `basedOn` names one — so renaming
 * one orphans every profile created from it.
