/**
 * The keybinding commands, callable by id.
 *
 * `ACTIONS` is only the chord registry: which ids exist and which key runs
 * them. What an id *does* lives in closures the app shell builds on every
 * render (`useActionHotkeys` in `App.tsx`). This module is where those
 * closures are reachable from outside the keydown handler, so a chord and a
 * programmatic caller — the command palette, or Atlas Agent's `ui_command`
 * — run the identical code.
 *
 * Only `global` commands are runnable here. A focus-scoped one (terminal
 * find, knowledge-base save…) means something only on its surface and is
 * dispatched by `useScopedHotkeys` there.
