// Collaboration, all at once: `acme-app` is bound to Cloud in the same
// Organisation team chat is connected to (`org-mock`), in the Workspace its
// Timeline rows already carry (`rw_1d55e903`). That is the one binding under
// which the agent composer's `@` picker offers every organisation kind —
// members (the Acme roster), conversations (team chat's joined channels and
// DMs) and recorded Sessions (your own plus two teammates') — see
// `features/chat/lib/org-mentions.ts`. The default scenario keeps `acme-app`
// in local capture so the capture popover's local states stay reachable.
