/**
 * The design-system gallery (decision 21) — `localhost:1420/?scenario=design-system`.
 *
 * It mounts as a SECOND React root over a hidden app root rather than replacing
 * `main.tsx`'s render. Two reasons: nothing dev-only has to reach into
 * production code to do it, and the app underneath stays mounted, so the theme
 * it hydrated (and the theme store the gallery's picker drives) is the real one
 * rather than a copy set up here.
 *
 * The gallery is imported lazily so that every other scenario — and every
 * production build, which never loads this file at all — pays nothing for it.
