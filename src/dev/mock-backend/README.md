# The browser mock backend

`bun run dev` runs the whole Atlas frontend in an ordinary browser against this
fake backend: Tauri's `mockIPC` answers every `invoke()` and `listen()` with
made-up data, so any screen can be opened, themed and reviewed without starting
a Rust build, an agent, or a real git operation.

Start here: `install.ts` explains how it is loaded, and why it loads the
fixtures through a dynamic `import()` of `backend.ts` (so `bun run dev:app`
never evaluates them); `backend.ts` says in what order a command is answered.
`types.ts` defines a scenario and the handler types. `scenarios/base.ts` is the
wiring point — every fixture file's handlers are spread into it.

```
localhost:1420/                     # the rich default scenario
localhost:1420/?scenario=git-conflict
```

`install.ts` also exports `installMockBackend(scenario?)` and
`resetStores()` (from `reset-stores.ts`). Neither is used by `bun run dev` —
they are decision 41's two affordances, so that a future Storybook decorator can
pick a scenario without a URL and isolate stores without fighting Zustand's
module singletons. Storybook itself is not in scope; `resetStores()` is callable
today as `__atlasMock.resetStores()`, and its first call is the one that defines
"clean".

The badge bottom-right counts **unmocked** commands. Click it to list them, or
run `__atlasMock.unmocked()` in the console. An unmocked command resolves
`null`, so an empty or broken panel is usually a missing fake here, not a UI
bug. `__atlasMock.actions.<name>()` fires a scenario's console triggers.

## Native-only surfaces

Three things in Atlas are not `invoke()` calls, so nothing in this directory
can stand in for them. A visual review done in the browser has not covered
them, and a change that touches one has to be checked in `bun run dev:app`:

- **The Browser tab.** It is a real child `WebviewWindow` positioned over the
  panel by the native window server. In the browser the panel draws its own
  chrome — tab strip, address bar, reader pane — and, where the page would be, a
  labelled **"Native-only surface"** placeholder (decision 39) naming what it is
  and where to check it. That placeholder is `NativeOnlyNotice` in
  `browser-panel.tsx`, gated on `isBrowserMock` (`src/lib/env.ts`) so it is
  dead-code-eliminated from production and never appears in `dev:app`; the
  normal start page is suppressed under the mock so the two do not stack. The
  `browser_embed_*` commands are answered as no-ops in `fixtures/misc.ts` so the
  badge stays honest about what is _missing_ rather than about what is _native_;
  `fetch_readable` is faked, because reader mode is ordinary themed HTML that
  Rust produces and the webview does not.
- **Finder drag-and-drop.** Dropping files onto the window, and pasting files
  from Finder, arrive through Tauri's native drag-drop channel and the
  `clipboard_file_paths` command reading the macOS pasteboard. The browser's own
  drag-and-drop is a different event with different data, so the in-app drop
  targets (chat attachments, the canvas, the comms composer, the explorer's
  move-by-drag) cannot be exercised here.
- **Native window chrome.** The traffic lights, the window's rounded corners and
  edge shadow, full-screen behaviour, the menu bar and the single-instance
  handoff are drawn by macOS, not by CSS. `window_zoom` and the
  `plugin:window|*` commands are answered so nothing throws, but the titlebar
  rendered in the browser is only the part Atlas draws itself.

Two more differences are worth remembering even where the fake works: Chrome is
not WKWebView (a final look in `bun run dev:app` is still the deciding one), and
this whole directory is injected by a `serve`-only Vite plugin and is a no-op
inside Tauri, so it never ships and never affects `dev:app`.

## Adding a fake

1. Find the command's return shape in `src-tauri/src/commands/<domain>.rs` —
   check the serde renaming, it is not always camelCase.
2. Add the command to the `<Domain>Responses` interface in
   `fixtures/<domain>.ts`, typed with the **frontend's** own type — the `T` of
   its `invoke<T>`, or `Unread` when the frontend never reads the answer, or
   `Unit` for `invoke<void>` — then write the fake in the map typed
   `TypedHandlers<<Domain>Responses>`. A fake with no entry, an entry with no
   fake, and an answer that does not match all fail `bun run typecheck`.
   **Import** the type; never restate it. If the app declares it without
   `export`, add the `export`. If it is an inline `invoke<{ … }>` inside an
   API wrapper, read it off the wrapper
   (`Awaited<ReturnType<typeof comms.send>>`). A copy compiles against itself,
   so it catches nothing: a rename on either side leaves both sides green.
3. Spread the handlers into `scenarios/base.ts`, and add the domain interface
   to `MockResponses` in `types.ts` so scenarios can override its commands.
4. Cover states, not happy paths: long names, errors, loading, empty, selected,
   disabled, unread, conflicted, running, cancelled. Colour lives in states, and
   this backend exists so a theme can be judged against them.
5. Make mutating commands mutate module-level state, so clicking changes what
   the screen shows.
