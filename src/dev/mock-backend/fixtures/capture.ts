// Session capture: the titlebar dot, the capture popover, the health banner.
//
// The base scenario answered `capture_health` with `off`, which is the one
// state that renders *nothing*: no radar, no banner, no queue row, no failed
// records, and a grey dot. Every affordance in the 1,400-line popover hangs off
// a binding that did not exist, so the surface could not be looked at at all.
//
// So the fakes are per project path, and the three seeded Projects are three
// different shapes on purpose:
//
//   acme-app          Local, capturing, degraded — flagged Sessions and failed
//                     records, so both warning affordances are on screen.
//   …-experiments     Cloud, connected, and the worst case: a dead git watcher
//                     (stopped) over a revoked sync (degraded), with a bulk
//                     import still waiting for review.
//   docs              Never enabled, and not a git repository — the unbound
//                     form plus the `git init` offer, with an empty preview.
//
// Health is *computed* from that state rather than stored, mirroring
// `atlas_checkpoint::health::evaluate` including its worst-first ordering and
// one-issue summary, so a mutation shows up in the dot and the banner the way
// it would in the real app: enabling flips the state off `off`, retrying moves
// failed records into the pending queue, retrying the watcher clears a
// `stopped` issue and leaves whatever else is wrong on screen.
//
// Cloud lands here in full: create, connect and promote are all reachable from
// the UI now that the ingest service serves its read endpoints, and Connect
// exercises the server's refusal-to-guess answer as well as the happy path.
