// `memory_graph_layout_save` is a pure passthrough in Rust
// (`commands/memory_graph.rs`) — it only ever persists px positions the
// frontend's live Matter world already had, and that world is walled to
// [0,width]×[0,height] (`memory-graph-canvas.tsx`'s wall bodies), top-left
// origin. A real saved layout can therefore never sit near (0,0)-centred
// negative coordinates; nothing in the live sim would push a node there and
// leave it. A fixture seed that gets this wrong renders a graph with a
// correct node/link count but an empty-looking canvas — nodes exist, are
// drawn, and sit permanently off-screen with no restoring force to bring
// them back. This is a regression guard for that failure mode, not a
// pixel-perfect layout check.
