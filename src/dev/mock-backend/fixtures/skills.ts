// Settings → Skills (Discover + My Skills) and Settings → Agents (the ACP
// registry marketplace), plus the agent catalog every other agent surface
// reads.
//
// Disk is the state for all of this in Rust: every mutation is written to the
// skills store / installed map and the panel refetches rather than patching
// locally. The fakes keep that contract — the module-level `installedSkills` /
// `installedPacks` / `registry` / `catalog` below ARE the disk, so projecting a
// skill, installing a pack or removing an agent actually changes what the next
// `skills_reconcile` / `pack_list` / `acp_registry_list` returns. Without that
// every toggle in those panels would snap back on the refetch that follows it.
//
// Two of these supersede the empty stubs `scenarios/base.ts` used to carry:
// `agents_catalog` and `acp_registry_list`. Empty listings left the marketplace
// grid, the composer's featured-agent offers and the skills tool matrix with
// nothing to draw, which is exactly the part worth looking at.
//
// Per ADR-0002 no agent is special-cased: the native agent is one catalog entry
// among the installed externals and the PATH detections, distinguished only by
// `kind: "native"` / `source: "in-process"` the way Rust distinguishes it.

## When to use it

- The user asks for it by name, or names the workflow it owns.
- A change touches the files listed under **Scope** below.

## Steps

1. Read the affected files before proposing an edit.
2. Make the smallest change that satisfies the request.
3. Run the verification command and paste its output back.

\`\`\`bash
${snippet}
\`\`\`

## Reference

| Option | Default | What it changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`--scope\` | \`global\` | Where the skill is read from. |
| \`--dry-run\` | \`false\` | Prints the plan without writing anything. |
| \`--verbose\` | \`false\` | Echoes every file the skill touched. |

> Skills are instructions, not code: nothing here runs on its own.
