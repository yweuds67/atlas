// Team chat (`comms`): a connected org with a populated sidebar, one long
// scrollable thread, and every awkward transcript row the real panel has to
// survive.
//
// Nothing here is a happy path on its own. The fixtures exist to put the
// states that only show up under load on screen at mount: a 46-message thread
// with code blocks, reactions, an edit, a deletion tombstone, an attachment
// and a send that failed; a conversation that is genuinely empty; unread
// counts and a mention badge; a channel name long enough to truncate
// everywhere it is rendered; a live call and an ended one.
//
// Writes mutate the module-level state and then announce themselves on
// `atlas:comms`, exactly as Rust does — because the store is a PROJECTION and
// builds nothing optimistically (`comms-store.ts`: "`send` does not build an
// optimistic row"). A fake that only resolved the invoke would leave every
// button inert: sending appends nothing, reading clears no badge, reacting
// paints no chip. Every mutating handler here therefore emits the event the
// store actually applies.
//
// Casing follows the wire, not the bridge: every field below is snake_case
// because these are wire objects (`atlas-comms::wire`, `#[serde]`-untouched),
// while the three DTOs Rust renames — `ConnectionInfoDto`, `DmResultDto`,
// `SendReceipt` — are camelCase. Each fake is typed with the frontend's own
// type so `bun run typecheck` catches drift from Rust.
