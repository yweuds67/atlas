// The Memory tab: Graph / Tree, Policy and Shared.
//
// Every one of its three views is gated on something expensive that a browser
// cannot have — a 90 MB on-device embedding model, a built vector index, a
// per-project event log — so without fakes the whole tab is three different
// empty states. The fakes here put it on the far side of all three gates: the
// model reads as downloaded, the index as built over the fake `acme-app` tree,
// and the shared log as a project two agents have been working in for a
// fortnight.
//
// A graph node id IS a corpus doc id (`claude:<file>.md`, `codex:<thread>`,
// `kb:<note>`, `shared:<kind>:<seq>`) — search maps `memory_index_query` hits
// back through them, so a mismatch shows as a search that finds nothing.
//
// Writes are kept for the session: appending an event, clearing a project,
// editing a policy value, toggling sharing, moving a node and re-indexing all
// survive until reload, so those controls do something.
