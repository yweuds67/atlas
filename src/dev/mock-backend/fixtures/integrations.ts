// The four surfaces that talk to something outside Atlas: the Atlas account
// (organisations, members, invitations), GitHub, the feedback panel with its
// native screenshot, and PDF annotations.
//
// They are one file because they share one fact — none of them can be reached
// from a browser, so every one of them is invisible until it is faked here.
//
// The account fakes start **signed in**. Signed out, the org switcher shows a
// "Connect" button and the members/invitations screens are unreachable, so a
// signed-out base would leave three quarters of `src/features/organisations/`
// with no way in. Sign-out still works (and sign-in back in, through a real
// `connecting` phase), so the signed-out half is a click away rather than the
// only thing on offer.
//
// Mutations here are real: inviting, removing, renaming the active org,
// cloning a repo, dropping a PDF highlight — all of them change what the next
// read returns, for the life of the page.

The single source of truth for Acme's colours, type ramp and spacing. Every
surface — web, iOS, the desktop app — reads from the same generated files.

## Install

\`\`\`bash
bun add @acme/design-tokens
\`\`\`

## Usage

\`\`\`ts
import { tokens } from "@acme/design-tokens";

document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--background", tokens.color.bg.base);
\`\`\`

## Layers

| Layer     | What it holds                         | Changes           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| primitive | Raw values (\`blue.500\`, \`space.4\`)    | Almost never      |
| semantic  | Roles (\`bg.base\`, \`text.secondary\`)   | Per theme         |
| component | Component overrides (\`button.bg\`)     | Per release       |

> Semantic tokens are the only layer product code may read. A component
> reaching past them into a primitive is a review comment, not a preference.

## Releasing

1. \`bun run build\` regenerates \`dist/\` for all four targets.
2. \`bun run check:contrast\` fails the build on any pair under 4.5:1.
3. Tag \`vX.Y.Z\`; CI publishes.

\`\`\`jsx
import useSWR from "swr";

  if (isLoading) return <div>loading…</div>;
