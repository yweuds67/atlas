/**
 * Every consumer that reads a RESOLVED theme colour must have a way to hear
 * that the theme changed.
 *
 * Most of Atlas recolours for free, because a CSS rule naming `var(--atlas-…)`
 * is late-bound: `applyTheme` rewrites the `:root` block and the next paint is
 * the new theme. The exceptions are the subsystems that cannot use a custom
 * property — a canvas, a WebGL scene, an xterm `ITheme`, a recharts `fill`, a
 * CodeMirror extension, a mermaid `themeVariables` — and they take a colour as
 * a VALUE, snapshotted at the moment they ask for it.
 *
 * A snapshot taken at construction and never refreshed is invisible in every
 * check that mounts the tree under the theme it is testing, which is how every
 * review of this work had been done. It only shows as "the terminal kept One
 * Dark's palette after I switched" once the app has been running a while. So
 * the invariant is enforced structurally: if a file calls a resolved-value
 * reader, it must also carry a subscription — or say, in a
 * `theme-subscription-allow:` comment, why it does not need one.
 *
 * The three ways to hear about it, all of them the same
 * `atlas:theme-applied` event that `applyTheme` dispatches:
 *
 *   `onThemeApplied(cb)`   imperative owners (xterm, the two pixi scenes)
 *   `useThemeVersion()`    React (recharts, mermaid, the dither field)
 *   a raw `window.addEventListener(THEME_APPLIED_EVENT, …)` (CodeMirror,
 *                          which reconfigures a compartment rather than
 *                          re-rendering)
 *
 * The browser pass of 2026-09-18 confirmed all seven subsystems repaint on a
 * switch-while-mounted; this is what keeps them that way.
