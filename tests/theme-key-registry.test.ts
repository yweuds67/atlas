/**
 * The theme-key registry has one source: `crates/atlas-theme/keys.toml`.
 *
 * The same facts used to live in five files — the TS registry, the Rust key
 * list, the JSON Schema, this repo's reference doc and the public one — each
 * hand-edited. Nothing compiled differently when they disagreed, so they did:
 * a "134 keys" count that was really 135, and a scrollbar rule documented as
 * "alpha/lighten" that is plain alpha, both shipped and both survived review.
 * The count is deliberately not restated here either: it is `keys.toml`'s to
 * know, and the 2026-09-18 audit changed it once already.
 *
 * So this suite is the whole point of the generator. `bun run theme:keys`
 * rewrites every derived file; this fails the build the moment one of them
 * stops matching the source, which is what makes the drift impossible rather
 * than merely noticed.
 *
 * It does NOT re-check the derivation results — `resolve-theme.test.ts` owns
 * that. It checks that the generated copies agree with the source.
