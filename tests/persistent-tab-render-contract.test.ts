/**
 * Guards `CenterPanel`'s persistent-tab render path.
 *
 * HISTORY. `TabContentContainer` used to mount persistent tab types through an
 * if/else-if chain keyed on `tab.type` that ended in an unconditional
 * `<TerminalPanel/>` fallback. `tsc` could not catch a missing branch there:
 * `tab.type` was typed as the full `TabType` union in every arm, so every
 * branch — including the fallback — type-checked whether or not it was the
 * *right* component. A type added to `PERSISTENT_TYPES` without a branch did
 * not fail to compile and did not throw; it silently fell into the terminal
 * branch and spawned a real PTY keyed to that tab's id.
 *
 * This shipped. Commit 32767aff8 ("comms UI update", 2026-09-11) added
 * `"spaces"` to `PERSISTENT_TYPES` and `IDLE_EXPENSIVE_TYPES` but never added
 * a matching branch, so opening a Space in alpha-0.3.2 mounted PowerShell
 * inside a tab titled "… — Space". Fixed by 1322c8f2.
 *
 * NOW. The lists are `as const` tuples, `persistentTabs` is narrowed by a type
 * predicate, and `PersistentPanel` is a `switch` whose `default` assigns
 * `tab.type` to `never`. A missing case is a COMPILE ERROR, which is a
 * stronger guarantee than anything this file can assert. What remains here is
 * the part the type system still cannot see:
 *
 *   1. that the `switch` has not been reshaped back into a catch-all — i.e.
 *      `<TerminalPanel/>` is only ever reached under `case "terminal":`;
 *   2. a readable, named restatement of the list relationship, so the failure
 *      message points at the history above rather than at a bare TS2322.
 *
 * We parse source text rather than rendering the component, matching
 * `ipc-contract.test.ts` / `state-payload-contract.test.ts`: it is cheap,
 * needs no DOM/store mocking, and importing `center-panel.tsx` would pull in
 * the whole lazy-loaded panel tree and every store it touches.
