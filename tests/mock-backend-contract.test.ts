/**
 * Guards the dev-only browser mock backend (`src/dev/mock-backend/`) against
 * the Rust it stands in for.
 *
 * `tests/ipc-contract.test.ts` already checks that every `invoke("name")` in
 * the app names a real command. The mock is the third side of that triangle
 * and nothing was watching it: its answers are keyed by command name in a
 * plain object, so a command Rust renamed or deleted leaves a fake behind that
 * is never called again. Nothing fails — the fixture just stops being reached,
 * and the screen it was there to populate quietly goes back to empty. That is
 * the exact failure the mock exists to prevent, so it should not be the mock's
 * own failure mode.
 *
 * What this does NOT check is the shape of an answer. The fixtures are typed
 * with the frontend's own API types, so `bun run typecheck` catches a fixture
 * that drifts from the TypeScript — but those types are hand-written mirrors
 * of the Rust structs, not generated from them, so Rust can change its
 * serialisation and both TypeScript sides stay wrong together. Closing that
 * hop means generated bindings (`ts-rs` / `tauri-specta`) and is deliberately
 * not attempted here; see the note in `ipc-contract.test.ts` on the same
 * trade-off.
 *
 * Imports the handler maps rather than parsing them, so a fixture that builds
 * its keys any way it likes is still counted.
