/**
 * The vendored engine phones home nowhere (issue #43, spec D2 / Phase 1).
 *
 * Two paths shipped inside the closure upstream, and D2 is explicit that they
 * are "removed (not just configured off) before any build leaves developers'
 * machines":
 *
 *   1. **OTLP metrics to Statsig.** `atlas-engine-otel` carried a built-in exporter
 *      posting to `https://ab.chatgpt.com/otlp/v1/metrics` with a **hardcoded
 *      client key**, and `atlas-engine-core` *defaulted* the metrics exporter to it
 *      (`core/src/config/otel.rs`). Upstream gated it on `cfg!(debug_assertions)`
 *      — which means it was live in exactly the builds that ship.
 *   2. **Per-session analytics to the ChatGPT backend.** `atlas-engine-analytics`
 *      POSTed to `{chatgpt_base_url}/<upstream name>/analytics-events/events`, was
 *      constructed for **every** session, was on unless config said otherwise,
 *      and sent a subset of events *even under plain API-key auth*.
 *
 * Research: `docs/archive/atlas-engine-fork-seam.md` §3 and its identity table.
 *
 * **Why a text test.** Neither path fails a build, a type-check, or a test when
 * it comes back. Both are reachable by an ordinary-looking edit — restoring an
 * enum variant, handing a base URL to a constructor — and the only symptom is
 * traffic leaving a user's machine. That is precisely the class cargo will
 * never announce, so it is asserted here instead.
 *
 * This is the permanent one. `engine-quarantine.test.ts` guards a condition that
 * ends when #45 rewires the seam; nothing ever makes this acceptable again.
