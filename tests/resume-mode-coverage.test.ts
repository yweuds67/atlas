/**
 * Every path that binds a tab to a live agent session must put the AGENT into
 * the mode the user last explicitly picked — not just the picker.
 *
 * `resume-mode.ts` (`applyModeOnResume`) is that one call, and it exists
 * because of issue 289's second bug: after a crash the engine came back on its
 * own default while the composer pill still showed the user's pick, so the
 * picker disagreed with the agent about what would be asked and what would
 * simply run. The three paths that existed when it landed — the history
 * sidebar, `openAgentSession`, and `session/new` — all call it.
 *
 * `rebindDisconnectedSession` (chat-panel) was the fourth, and it did not: it
 * respawns the agent and re-binds, and a bind does not clear
 * `acpModeExplicit`/`acpCurrentMode`, so the pill survived the restart while
 * the fresh agent enforced its own default. Same failure, one path over —
 * reachable from the "Restart agent" banner and from the next Send after a
 * disconnect, the latter with the queued prompt already racing it.
 *
 * Nothing type-checks this. `applyModeOnResume` returns `Promise<void>`, a
 * forgotten call is not a compile error, and the symptom is invisible until a
 * real agent runs a command under a mode the user never chose. So: read the
 * sources and assert each bind site calls it, the way
 * `ipc-contract.test.ts` / `next-steps-marker-parity.test.ts` do. Parsing text
 * rather than rendering means no store/DOM mocking and no agent.
 *
 * The list below is deliberately an ENUMERATION, not a search for every
 * `setAcpBinding` call: the point is to name the paths, so a new one has to be
 * added here and thought about rather than picked up silently. A site that
 * binds a session but is deliberately exempt says so in `note`.
