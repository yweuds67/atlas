/**
 * Guards the root cargo workspace (issue #38, spec D4 / Phase 0).
 *
 * Atlas had no `[workspace]` until the engine port: the old ACP stack pinned
 * `agent-client-protocol` 1.3 with an exact schema pin, the ported one pins
 * 2.0, and no single resolution could hold both. That collision is gone —
 * every consumer is on `=2.0.0` — and the port needs one workspace so the
 * vendored engine resolves against the same graph as the app.
 *
 * Three cargo rules make this checkable as text, and make silent breakage
 * likely without a check:
 *
 *   1. `[patch.crates-io]` is honored ONLY in the manifest cargo was invoked
 *      on. In a workspace that is always the root, so a patch table left
 *      behind in a member is dead config that cargo ignores without a word.
 *   2. `[profile.*]` in a non-root member is likewise ignored (cargo warns,
 *      but warnings scroll past).
 *   3. `[profile.dev.package."*"]` applies to *dependencies only*. Every
 *      Atlas crate that became a member therefore fell out of it — from
 *      opt-level 1 to 0 — unless its opt-level is restated per package. That
 *      is a pure `tauri dev` slowdown with no compile error to announce it.
 *
 * Same approach as `ci-coverage.test.ts`: line regexes over manifests we own,
 * with floor assertions so a regex that stops matching fails loudly instead of
 * passing vacuously.
