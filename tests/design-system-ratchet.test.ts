/**
 * The design-system ratchet (decision 33) — closed at zero.
 *
 * Foundations put the type, radius, elevation, z-index and motion scales in
 * Tailwind namespaces, but the 2026-09-17 audit found the app almost entirely
 * off them: 95% of 1,427 font-size utilities were arbitrary, nearly every
 * floating layer sat at a hand-written 9999–100000, there were 686 colour
 * literals in 141 files, and 56 inline `zIndex` values. None of that compiles
 * differently, so nothing else in the toolchain can see it — a new
 * `text-[11.5px]` type-checks, lints, renders, and is invisible until someone
 * re-reads the file.
 *
 * It ran as a RATCHET through the sweep: committed counts in
 * `design-system-ratchet.baseline.json` that could only go down. **The sweep
 * finished and every count reached zero**, so the baseline is gone and this is
 * now a ban: a new violation fails, full stop.
 *
 * That only works because the exits are real ones. A value that genuinely
 * cannot come from the scale gets `EXEMPT_FILES` (a whole file that DEFINES
 * the scale, or whose colours are not Atlas's to choose) or an inline
 * `ratchet-allow: <reason>` marker at the site. Both demand prose, and both
 * are checked: an exemption with no argument next to it fails the suite too.
 * If you are reaching for one, read what the existing entries argue before
 * adding another — "it has a lot of them" is not one of the arguments.
 *
 * Scope is every folder that renders: `src/features`, `src/components`,
 * `src/ui` and `src/dev`. `src/styles` is the only wholesale exclusion left —
 * it IS the scale, so "use the scale instead" cannot apply to it.
 *
 * `src/ui` and `src/dev` used to be excluded wholesale on the same argument,
 * and the argument was untrue of almost every file in them: the 2026-09-18
 * review found a hardcoded white canvas ink and a literal 50%-black popover
 * shadow hiding in `src/ui`, neither of which defines anything. Of the 19 files
 * in `src/ui` exactly those two carried a violation, so there is no residue to
 * exempt. `src/dev` keeps a narrow exemption for the fixture files whose
 * CONTENT is colours (theme files, fake source listings) — see `EXEMPT_FILES`.
