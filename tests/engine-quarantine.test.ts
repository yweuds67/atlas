/**
 * Keeps the vendored engine quarantined (issue #42, spec D2 / Phase 1).
 *
 * The engine landed whole and compiles as workspace members, but **nothing
 * that ships may depend on it** until the seam is rewired (#45) and the
 * phone-home paths are ripped out (#43). Those two are the reason the
 * quarantine is not merely tidiness: `atlas-engine-analytics` and `atlas-engine-otel` are in
 * the closure, and both phone home — one to a Statsig endpoint with a
 * hardcoded client key, one to the ChatGPT backend, the second of which sends
 * events *even under plain API-key auth* (fork-seam §3). D2 is explicit that
 * these are removed "before any build leaves developers' machines". A stray
 * `atlas-engine-*` dependency added to `src-tauri` before #43 lands would ship them.
 *
 * Cargo cannot enforce this. An unused workspace member is not an error, and
 * adding a dependency on one is the most ordinary edit there is — it compiles,
 * it passes clippy, and the only symptom is in the shipped binary.
 *
 * The shape is an allowlist of manifests permitted to name the dependency,
 * enforced over every manifest Atlas owns.
 *
 * **#45 opened the first hole in it, on purpose**, and **#54 widened it to its
 * final shape.** The seam crate links the engine — that is what "rewire the
 * seam" meant — so `crates/atlas-native-agent` is allowlisted below. It used to
 * be additionally gated behind the `ported-engine` feature so a shipping build
 * contained no engine at all; that gate is gone with the previous native path it existed
 * to protect, because the engine *is* the native agent now.
 *
 * What survives, and is the whole of the rule that still matters: **exactly one
 * manifest may name a `atlas-engine-*` crate.** The engine reaching one crate on
 * purpose is the architecture. It reaching a second by accident is the leak,
 * and that is what this file catches.
