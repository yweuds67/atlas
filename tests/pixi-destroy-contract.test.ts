/**
 * The graph components destroy their pixi `Application` through
 * `destroyPixiApp`, never directly.
 *
 * `destroy(true, …)` reads as "remove the canvas" but also means
 * `releaseGlobalResources`, which frees pixi's process-global batch, texture
 * and canvas pools while the OTHER live renderer still uses them. That one
 * throws inside `DefaultBatcher.break` a frame later, too late for any
 * try/catch around the destroy to see. `src/lib/pixi-app.ts` exists to count
 * live Applications and release the pools only with the last one; this guards
 * the two call sites so the shorthand cannot come back.
